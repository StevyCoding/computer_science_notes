## Structured Query Language (SQL)
SQL is a language used for interacting with Relational Database  Management Systems (RDBMS)
- You can use SQL to get the RDBMS to do things for 
	- Create, retrieve, update & delete data 
	- Create & manage databases
	- Design & create database tables
	- Perform administration tasks ( security, user management, import/export, etc.)
## not same in every RDBMS
SQL implementation vary between systems
- Not all RDBMS's follow the SQL standard to a 'T'
- The concepts are the same but the implementation may vary

## compose of 4 languages
SQL is actually a hybrid language,, it's basically 4 types of languages in one
- Data Query Language (DQL)
	- Used to query database for information
	- Get information that is already stored there
- Data definition Language (DDL)
	- Used for defining database schemas
- Data Control Language (DCL)
	- Used for controlling access to the data in the database
	- User & permission management
- Data Manipulation Language (DML)
	- Used for inserting, updating and deleting data from the database


## Queries
A query  is a set of instructions given to the RDBMS ( written is SQL )  that tell the RDBMS what information you want it to retrieve for you
- TONS of data in a DB
- Often hidden in a complex schema
- Goal is to only get the data you need
```sql
SELECT employee.name, employee.age FROM employee WHERE employee.salary > 3000;
```
