A SQL join isÂ **a logical combination of two SQL tables**. There are a number of ways to join tables together, most of which involve finding common values between the two. SQL joins are what make normalization possible, as they allow queries to return results that stretch across multiple tables.
```sql 
-- Find all branches and the names of their managers
SELECT employee.emp_id, employee.first_name, branch.branch_name FROM employeee
JOIN branch ON employee.emp_id = branch.mgr_id
```

Alright, imagine you have two groups of friends: one group is called "Students" and the other is called "Teachers." Each person in these groups has some information about themselves, like their name and age. Now, let's say you want to create a list that includes both students and teachers and shows their information side by side.

Here's where the SQL (Structured Query Language) comes in. SQL is like a language that helps you talk to a database, which is like a super organized way to store information.

1. **JOIN:**
    
    - JOIN is like bringing both groups of friends together to make a big combined group.
    - If you use a regular JOIN, you only get the people who are both students and teachers. So, you only get the people who are in both groups.
    - In SQL, it looks something like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Students
JOIN Teachers ON Students.id = Teachers.id;
```
 - This will give you a list of people who are both students and teachers, and you'll see their information side by side.
2. **LEFT JOIN:**
    
    - Now, a LEFT JOIN is like making sure you get everyone from the "Students" group and also bringing in the matching people from the "Teachers" group.
    - Even if someone is only a student and not a teacher, they'll still show up in the list. But if someone is only a teacher and not a student, they won't be left out either.
    - In SQL, it looks like this:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Students
LEFT JOIN Teachers ON Students.id = Teachers.id;
```
1. - This will give you a list of all students and also include teachers if they match with students. If a teacher doesn't have a corresponding student, you'll still see the student's information, but the teacher's info will be blank for those rows.

**RIGHT JOIN:**

- A RIGHT JOIN is like making sure you get everyone from the "Teachers" group and bringing in the matching people from the "Students" group.
- Even if someone is only a teacher and not a student, they'll still show up in the list. But if someone is only a student and not a teacher, they won't be left out.
- In SQL, it looks like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Students
RIGHT JOIN Teachers ON Students.id = Teachers.id;
```

- This will give you a list of all teachers and also include students if they match with teachers. If a student doesn't have a corresponding teacher, you'll still see the teacher's information, but the student's info will be blank for those rows.

In summary:

- **JOIN** gives you the common elements between two groups.
- **LEFT JOIN** gives you all elements from the left group and the common elements from the right group.
- **RIGHT JOIN** gives you all elements from the right group and the common elements from the left group.

It's like making sure you include everyone from one group, and if they have a match in the other group, you bring in that information too!
