What Is UNION in SQL?Â **The UNION operator is used to combine the data from the result of two or more SELECT command queries into a single distinct result set**. This operator removes any duplicates present in the results being combined. To understand this operator, let's get an insight into its syntax.

```sql
Select first_name FROM employee 
UNION
SELECT branc_name FROM branch
```
