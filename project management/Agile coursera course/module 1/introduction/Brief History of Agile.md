# Waterfall
The waterfall approach is a traditional and linear project management methodology that follows a sequential, step-by-step process to deliver a project. It is characterized by a rigid structure where each phase must be completed before moving on to the next. The key phases of the waterfall approach typically include:

1. **Requirements Gathering:** In this initial phase, project requirements are gathered and documented. Stakeholders collaborate to define the project's objectives, scope, and functionality.
    
2. **System Design:** Based on the gathered requirements, the system architecture and design are created. This phase involves planning the overall structure of the project, including hardware, software, and any other components.
    
3. **Implementation:** The actual development or coding of the project takes place in this phase. Developers build the system according to the specifications outlined in the design phase.
    
4. **Testing:** After implementation, the system undergoes rigorous testing to identify and fix any bugs or issues. Testing ensures that the system meets the specified requirements and functions as intended.
    
5. **Deployment:** Once the system passes testing, it is deployed or released to the end-users. This phase involves delivering the product to the customer or making it available to the target audience.
    
6. **Maintenance:** After deployment, the system requires ongoing maintenance and support. This phase involves addressing any issues that arise, releasing updates, and ensuring the continued functionality of the system.
    

The waterfall approach is known for its structured and disciplined nature. It provides a clear framework for project development, making it easier to manage and plan. However, one of its main drawbacks is its inflexibility. Once a phase is completed, it's challenging to go back and make changes without affecting the entire project. This can be a limitation in dynamic or rapidly changing environments where requirements may evolve.

In contrast to more iterative and flexible methodologies like Agile, which allow for incremental development and frequent reassessment of priorities, the waterfall approach is best suited for projects with well-defined and stable requirements.
