Kanban is a popular agile methodology that originated in manufacturing, particularly at Toyota, and has since been adapted for various industries, including software development and project management. The primary focus of Kanban is on visualizing work, limiting work in progress, and maximizing flow to improve efficiency and deliver value continuously. Here are the key principles and practices of the Kanban methodology:

1. **Visualization:** The Kanban board is a visual representation of the work process. It consists of columns representing different stages of the workflow, and each column contains cards representing individual tasks or work items. This visualization provides a clear and shared understanding of the work in progress.
    
2. **Work in Progress (WIP) Limits:** One of the core principles of Kanban is to limit the amount of work in progress at any given time. WIP limits help prevent overloading the team and ensure that work is completed before new tasks are started. This promotes a smooth and efficient flow of work through the system.
    
3. **Flow:** Kanban emphasizes the continuous flow of work from start to finish. Teams strive to minimize bottlenecks and interruptions in the workflow to ensure a steady and predictable delivery of value. Flow metrics, such as lead time and cycle time, are often used to measure and improve the efficiency of the process.
    
4. **Pull System:** Work is pulled into the system based on capacity rather than pushed into the system. Team members pull new work only when they have the capacity to do so, helping to maintain a balanced workflow and prevent overloading.
    
5. **Continuous Improvement:** Kanban encourages a culture of continuous improvement. Teams regularly review their processes and make incremental adjustments to improve efficiency and effectiveness. This is often done through regular retrospective meetings where the team reflects on their performance and identifies areas for improvement.
    
6. **Feedback Loops:** Kanban promotes the use of feedback loops to identify issues and make timely adjustments. Visualizing work on the Kanban board allows team members to quickly identify bottlenecks or areas of concern, enabling them to address issues promptly.
    
7. **Explicit Policies:** Teams using Kanban define explicit policies for each stage of the workflow. These policies outline the criteria for moving tasks from one stage to another, providing clarity and alignment on how work is to be done.
    

Kanban is known for its flexibility and adaptability, making it suitable for a wide range of projects and processes. It is particularly well-suited for environments where work items are variable and priorities may change frequently. The methodology promotes a customer-centric approach by focusing on delivering value continuously and responding to changing requirements effectively.
