XP, or Extreme Programming, is an agile software development methodology that emphasizes customer satisfaction, flexibility, and high-quality software development. It was introduced by Kent Beck in the late 1990s and is designed to improve software development processes and deliver valuable software incrementally. XP is known for its focus on collaboration, simplicity, and continuous feedback. Here are the key principles and practices of Extreme Programming:

1. **Customer Involvement:** XP places a strong emphasis on customer involvement throughout the development process. Customers are considered part of the development team and are actively engaged in defining requirements, setting priorities, and providing feedback on the delivered software.
    
2. **Incremental Planning:** XP promotes incremental planning, where only the most critical features are planned in detail initially. As the project progresses, the team collaboratively plans and adjusts priorities based on customer feedback and changing requirements.
    
3. **Small Releases:** XP advocates for frequent and small releases of the software. This allows the team to deliver value to the customer regularly and receive feedback early in the development process. Small releases also help in managing risk and adapting to changes more effectively.
    
4. **Continuous Integration:** Continuous Integration (CI) is a practice in XP where code changes from multiple developers are integrated into a shared repository multiple times a day. This ensures that the software is always in a working state and helps identify and address integration issues early.
    
5. **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** TDD is a core practice in XP where developers write automated tests before writing the actual code. This ensures that the code meets the specified requirements and allows for rapid feedback on any potential issues.
    
6. **Pair Programming:** XP encourages pair programming, where two developers work together at one computer. One writes the code (the driver), while the other reviews each line of code as it is written (the observer). Pair programming enhances code quality, promotes knowledge sharing, and reduces the likelihood of defects.
    
7. **Refactoring:** XP promotes continuous code improvement through refactoring. Developers are encouraged to regularly refactor code to improve its design, readability, and maintainability without changing its external behavior.
    
8. **Collective Code Ownership:** All team members are responsible for the codebase, and there is no individual ownership of specific components. This promotes collaboration, knowledge sharing, and flexibility within the team.
    
9. **Sustainable Pace:** XP emphasizes maintaining a sustainable pace of work to prevent burnout and maintain high levels of productivity over the long term. This includes regular working hours and avoiding long periods of overtime.
    
10. **On-Site Customer:** Having an on-site customer, or close collaboration with the customer, is preferred in XP. This allows for quick and effective communication, immediate feedback, and a better understanding of customer needs.
    

Extreme Programming is well-suited for projects where requirements are expected to change frequently, and a high degree of collaboration with customers and stakeholders is essential for success. It is designed to be adaptable and responsive to changing circumstances throughout the software development lifecycle.
