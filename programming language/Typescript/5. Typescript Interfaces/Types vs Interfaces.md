In TypeScript, both types and interfaces can be used to define the structure of objects and enforce type checks. However, there are some differences between the two.

Types are used to create a new named type based on an existing type or to combine existing types into a new type. They can be created using the type keyword. For example:

```js
type Person = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

const person: Person = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  age: 30,
};
```

Interfaces, on the other hand, are used to describe the structure of objects and classes. They can be created using the interface keyword. For example:

```js
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

const person: Person = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  age: 30,
};
```
