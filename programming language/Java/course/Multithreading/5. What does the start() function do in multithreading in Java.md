**What happens when a function is called?**   
When a function is called the following operations take place:   
 

1. The arguments are evaluated.
2. A new stack frame is pushed into the call stack.
3. Parameters are initialized.
4. Method body is executed.
5. Value is returned and current stack frame is popped from the call stack.

**The purpose of start() is to create a separate call stack for the thread. A separate call stack is created by it, and then run() is called by JVM.**  
Let us see what happens if we don’t call start() and rather call run() directly. We have modified the first program discussed [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multithreading-in-java/).

```java
// Java code to see that all threads are
// pushed on same stack if we use run()
// instead of start().
class ThreadTest extends Thread
{
public void run()
{
	try
	{
	// Displaying the thread that is running
	System.out.println ("Thread " +
				Thread.currentThread().getId() +
				" is running");

	}
	catch (Exception e)
	{
	// Throwing an exception
	System.out.println ("Exception is caught");
	}
}
}

// Main Class
public class Main
{
public static void main(String[] args)
{
	int n = 8;
	for (int i=0; i<n; i++)
	{
	ThreadTest object = new ThreadTest();

	// start() is replaced with run() for
	// seeing the purpose of start
	object.run();
	}
}
}

```

Output :
```bash
Thread 1 is running
Thread 1 is running
Thread 1 is running
Thread 1 is running
Thread 1 is running
Thread 1 is running
Thread 1 is running
Thread 1 is running
```

We can see from above output that we get same ids for all threads because we have directly called run(). The program that calls start() prints different ids (see [this](https://ide.geeksforgeeks.org/UeWewe))
