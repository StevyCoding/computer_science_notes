**New:** Thread is created but hasn't started running yet.

**Runnable:** Thread is ready to run, waiting for CPU time. Imagine threads in a queue, all waiting their turn.

**Blocked:** Thread is stuck waiting for something (e.g., a lock held by another thread). Like waiting in line for the restroom.

**Waiting:** Thread is paused due to `wait()` or `join()`, waiting for an event (like a notification) or another thread to finish. Similar to waiting for a friend at a meeting point.

**Timed Waiting:** Thread is paused with a timeout (e.g., `sleep()`). It waits for the timeout or an event, whichever comes first. Like waiting for a bus for a specific amount of time.

**Terminated:** Thread has finished running, either normally or due to an error. It's done and won't run again. Like leaving a movie theater.
