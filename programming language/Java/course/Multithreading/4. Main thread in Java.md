When a Jafva program start up, one thread begin running immediately. This is usually called the main thread of our program because it is the one that is executed when our program begins.

**There are certain properties associated with the main thread which are as follows:**

- It is the thread from which other “child” threads will be spawned.
- Often, it must be the last thread to finish execution because it performs various shutdown actions

The flow diagram is as follows:

## How to control the main thread

```java
// Java program to control the Main Thread

// Importing required classes
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

// Class 1
// Main class extending thread class
public class Test extends Thread {

	// Main driver method
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{

		// Getting reference to Main thread
		Thread t = Thread.currentThread();

		// Getting name of Main thread
		System.out.println("Current thread: "
						+ t.getName());

		// Changing the name of Main thread
		t.setName("Geeks");
		System.out.println("After name change: "
						+ t.getName());

		// Getting priority of Main thread
		System.out.println("Main thread priority: "
						+ t.getPriority());

		// Setting priority of Main thread to MAX(10)
		t.setPriority(MAX_PRIORITY);

		// Print and display the main thread priority
		System.out.println("Main thread new priority: "
						+ t.getPriority());

		for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
			System.out.println("Main thread");
		}

		// Main thread creating a child thread
		Thread ct = new Thread() {
			// run() method of a thread
			public void run()
			{

				for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
					System.out.println("Child thread");
				}
			}
		};

		// Getting priority of child thread
		// which will be inherited from Main thread
		// as it is created by Main thread
		System.out.println("Child thread priority: "
						+ ct.getPriority());

		// Setting priority of Main thread to MIN(1)
		ct.setPriority(MIN_PRIORITY);

		System.out.println("Child thread new priority: "
						+ ct.getPriority());

		// Starting child thread
		ct.start();
	}
}

// Class 2
// Helper class extending Thread class
// Child Thread class
class ChildThread extends Thread {

	@Override public void run()
	{

		for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {

			// Print statement whenever child thread is
			// called
			System.out.println("Child thread");
		}
	}
}
```

Deadlock defiinition :

```java
// Java program to demonstrate deadlock
// using Main thread

// Main class
public class GFG {

// Main driver method
public static void main(String[] args) {

	// Try block to check for exceptions
	try {

	// Print statement
	System.out.println("Entering into Deadlock");

	// Joining the current thread
	Thread.currentThread().join();

	// This statement will never execute
	System.out.println("This statement will never execute");
	}

	// Catch block to handle the exceptions
	catch (InterruptedException e) {

	// Display the exception along with line number
	// using printStackTrace() method
	e.printStackTrace();
	}
}
}
```

The statement `Thread.currentThread().join()`, will tell Main thread to wait for this thread(i.e. wait for itself) to die. Thus Main thread wait for itself to die, which is nothing but a deadlock.
