Thread synchronization mechanism can be achieved using Lock framework, which is present in **java.util.concurrent** package. Lock framework works like synchronized blocks except locks can be more sophisticated than Java’s synchronized blocks. Locks allow more flexible structuring of synchronized code. This new approach was introduced in `Java 5` to tackle the below-mentioned problem of [synchronization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/synchronization-in-java/).

example : 

```Java
Lock lock = new ReentrantLock();
lock.lock();

// Critical section
lock.unlock();
```
