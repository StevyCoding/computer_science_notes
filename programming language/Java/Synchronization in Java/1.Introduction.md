Multi-threaded programs may often come to a situation where multiple threads try to access the same resources and finally produce erroneous and unforeseen results.

#  Why  use Java Synchronization ?

Java Synchronization provide a way to creating threads and synchronizing their tasks using synchronized blocks.

A synchronized block in Java is synchronized in some object.All synchronized on the same object and can only have one thread executed insid them at a time. All other threads attempting to enter the synchronized block are blocked until the thread inside the synchronized block exits the block.

```java
// Only one thread can execute at a time. 
// sync_object is a reference to an object
// whose lock associates with the [monitor](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/monitors-in-process-synchronization/). 
// The code is said to be synchronized on
// the monitor object
synchronized(sync_object)
{
   // Access shared variables and other
   // shared resources
}
```

## Type of Synchronizatiopn

1. Process Synchronization 
2. Thread synchronization

### 1. Process Synchronization in Java

Process Synchronization is a technique used to coordinate the execution of multiple processes. It ensures that the shared resources are safe and in order.

###  2.  Thread Synchronization in Java

Thread Synchronization is used to coordinate and ordering of the execution of the threads in a multi-threaded program. There are two types of thread synchronization are mentioned below:

- Mutual Exclusive
- Cooperation (Inter-thread communication in Java)

<u>Mutual Exclusive</u>

Mutual Exclusive helps keep threads from interfering with one another while sharing data. There are three types of Mutual Exclusive mentioned below:

- Synchronized method.
- Synchronized block.
- Static synchronization.

## Example of Synchronization

```java
// A Java program to demonstrate working of
// synchronized.

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

// A Class used to send a message
class Sender {
	public void send(String msg)
	{
		System.out.println("Sending\t" + msg);
		try {
			Thread.sleep(1000);
		}
		catch (Exception e) {
			System.out.println("Thread interrupted.");
		}
		System.out.println("\n" + msg + "Sent");
	}
}

// Class for send a message using Threads
class ThreadedSend extends Thread {
	private String msg;
	Sender sender;

	// Receives a message object and a string
	// message to be sent
	ThreadedSend(String m, Sender obj)
	{
		msg = m;
		sender = obj;
	}

	public void run()
	{
		// Only one thread can send a message
		// at a time.
		synchronized (sender)
		{
			// synchronizing the send object
			sender.send(msg);
		}
	}
}

// Driver class
class SyncDemo {
	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		Sender send = new Sender();
		ThreadedSend S1 = new ThreadedSend(" Hi ", send);
		ThreadedSend S2 = new ThreadedSend(" Bye ", send);

		// Start two threads of ThreadedSend type
		S1.start();
		S2.start();

		// wait for threads to end
		try {
			S1.join();
			S2.join();
		}
		catch (Exception e) {
			System.out.println("Interrupted");
		}
	}
}

```
