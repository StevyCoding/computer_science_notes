Now that we understand the basics of multithreading and thread priorities, let's delve into a crucial concept: **Thread Synchronization**.

As we discussed, multithreading allows programs to handle multiple tasks concurrently. However, when multiple threads access the same resources (like data or hardware) simultaneously, it can lead to problems. Imagine two threads trying to update the same bank account balance at the same time - the outcome could be unpredictable and incorrect.

This is where thread synchronization comes in. It ensures that only one thread can access a shared resource at a time, preventing conflicts and maintaining data integrity.

Here's an analogy:

- Think of a printer shared by multiple computers in an office. Without synchronization, two computers might try to print documents simultaneously, leading to a jumbled mess.
- Thread synchronization acts like a queue system for the printer. Only one computer can print at a time, ensuring clear and accurate output.

Java provides mechanisms like synchronized methods, blocks, and locks to achieve thread synchronization. These tools guarantee that only one thread can execute a specific code section or access a particular resource at a time.

By implementing proper synchronization techniques, we can ensure that our multithreaded programs run smoothly and produce reliable results. This is essential for building robust and efficient applications that can leverage the power of multithreading effectively.


##  Types of synchronization  

1.  Process synchronization
2. Thread synchronization

Here  we will be mainly focus on thread synchronization.

**Thread synchronization ensures only one thread accesses a shared resource at a time**. This prevents conflicts and data inconsistencies. It's like using locks to take turns modifying a document - one person writes at a time to avoid a mess. In Java, monitors act as these locks, allowing only one thread to "own" the resource at a time. Other threads wait until the first one finishes and releases the lock.

### Thread synchronisation are of two types
1. Mutual Exclusive
2. Inter-Th0read Communication

#### A. Mutual Exclusive

While sharing any resource, this will keep the thread interfering with one another i.e. mutual exclusive. We can achieve this via

- Synchronized Method
- Synchronized Block
- Static Synchronization

##### Synchronized Method

We can declare a method as synchronized using the [_“synchronized”_](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/synchronized-in-java/) keyword. This will make the code written inside the method thread-safe so that no other thread will execute while the resource is shared.

**Implementation:**

We will be proposing prints the two threads simultaneously showing the asynchronous behavior without thread synchronization.

#### B. Synchronized Block
If we declare a block as synchronized, only the code which is written inside that block is executed sequentially not the complete code. This is used when we want sequential access to some part of code or to synchronize some part of code.

```java
synchronized (object reference) 
{    
   // Insert code here
}
```

#### C.  Static Synchronized 

In this, the synchronized method is declared as **“static”** which means the lock or monitor is applied on the class not on the object so that only one thread will access the class at a time.
