Here's a concise explanation of synchronization in Java:

**`synchronized` Keyword:**

- Used with methods or blocks, not variables or classes.
- Ensures only one thread accesses a shared object at a time.
- Acts like a lock to prevent data inconsistencies when multiple threads modify the same object.
- **Benefits:** Prevents data races and inconsistencies.
- **Drawbacks:** Can increase thread wait time and impact performance. Use only when necessary.

`Lock and Object` **Relationship:**

- Every Java object has an associated lock (monitor).
- When a thread calls a synchronized method, it acquires the object's lock.
- Other threads trying to access synchronized methods on the same object wait until the lock is released.
- Non-synchronized methods can be called concurrently by multiple threads on the same object.
