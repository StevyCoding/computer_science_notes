Oracle Certified Professional Certification was one of the goals I planned to achieve in 3 years while learning the Java programming language. Due to the difficulty of the exam and the level of expertise it aims to measure, I thought it would be a better course of action to take this exam after finding a job in Java and working as a Java Developer for at least one year.

As a matter of fact, Oracle, a California/USA-based company that has been developing the Java language for many years, had set a very [ambitious goal](https://education.oracle.com/oracle-certified-professional-java-se-17-developer/trackp_OCPJSE17) for the exam:

_An Oracle Certified Professional: Java SE 17 Developer has demonstrated proficiency in Java (Standard Edition) software development recognized by a wide range of world-wide industries. They have also exhibited thorough and broad knowledge of the Java programming language, coding practices, and utilization of new features incorporated into Java SE 17. By passing the required exam, a certified individual proves tremendous fluency in Java SE and the acquisition of the valuable professional skills required to be a Java software developer._

## 1- Choosing the Right Source

As you know, there is an unlimited number/variety of resources in the software market and it is very important to find the right resource that will lead you to your goal. As a result of my research, I purchased the [_OCP Oracle Certified Professional Java SE 17 Developer Study Guide: Exam 1Z0–829_](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/OCP+Oracle+Certified+Professional+Java+SE+17+Developer+Study+Guide%3A+Exam+1Z0+829-p-9781119864585) by **Scott Selikoff** and **Jeanne Boyarsky**.

Oracle Certified Professional Java SE17 Developer Study Guide

The book is 961 pages in total and consists of 15 chapters. The chapters completely cover the scope of the exam set by Oracle. The best part is, heavy and comprehensive topics are explained in plain English and with good examples.

> **_Chapter 1:_** _Building Blocks describes the basics of Java, such as how to run a program. It covers variables such as primitives, object data types, and scoping variables. It also discusses garbage collection._**_Chapter 2:_** _Operators explains operations with variables. It also talks about casting and the precedence of operators._**_Chapter 3:_** _Making Decisions covers core logical constructs such as decision statements, pattern matching, and loops._**_Chapter 4:_** _Core APIs works with String, StringBuilder, arrays, and dates._**_Chapter 5:_** _Methods explains how to design and write methods. It also introduces access modifiers, which are used throughout the book.  
> _**_Chapter 6:_** _Class Design covers class structure, constructors, inheritance, and initialization. It also teaches you how to create abstract classes and overload methods.  
> _**_Chapter 7:_** _Beyond Classes introduces many top-level types (other than classes), including interfaces, enums, sealed classes, records, and nested classes. It also covers polymorphism.  
> _**_Chapter 8:_** _Lambdas and Functional Interfaces shows how to use lambdas, method references, and built-in functional interfaces._**_Chapter 9:_** _Collections and Generics demonstrates method references, generics with wildcards, and Collections. The Collections portion covers many common interfaces, classes, and methods that are useful for the exam and in everyday software development.  
> _**_Chapter 10:_** _Streams explains stream pipelines in detail. It also covers the Optional class. If you want to become skilled at creating streams, read this chapter more than once!_**_Chapter 11:_** _Exceptions and Localization demonstrates the different types of exception classes and how to apply them to build more resilient programs. It concludes with localization and formatting, which allow your program to gracefully support multiple countries or languages.  
> _**_Chapter 12:_** _Modules details the benefits of the new module feature. It shows how to compile and run module programs from the command line. Additionally, it describes services and how to migrate an application to a modular infrastructure._**_Chapter 13:_** _Concurrency introduces the concept of thread life cycle and thread-safety. It teaches you how to build multithreaded programs using the Concurrency API and parallel streams._**_Chapter 14:_** _I/O introduces you to managing files and directories using the I/O and NIO.2 APIs. It covers a number of I/O stream classes, teaches you how to serialize data, and shows how to interact with a user. Additionally, it includes techniques for using streams to traverse and search the file system._**_Chapter 15:_** _JDBC provides the basics of working with databases in Java, including working with stored procedures and transactions._

Considering the length of the sourcebook and the weight of some topics, I decided to finish the first round of reading in **2 months**.

At the end of 2 months, I reread the underlined parts and answered the relevant post-chapter tests, which took me about **1 month**. Unfortunately, my success rate in the post-chapter tests was **around 50%**. From this result, I concluded that some of the topics were not fully settled in my mind and that I needed to study them in more detail.

While studying the last chapters of the book, I observed that I could not remember some of the details from the first chapters, so I decided to summarize the book and review it faster.

In order to do this, I needed to carve out additional time for myself. For this purpose, I deleted all social media applications (Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, and Facebook) from my mobile phone. This gave me at least **1-hour extra time per day**.

In order to better absorb concepts/topics that are difficult to understand and to master the details, I thought it would be useful to solve the post-chapter tests by discussing them with another developer. I proposed this to a developer whose posts on the Turkey Java Community Discord channel caught my attention and who I thought might be interested. Upon his acceptance, we started to meet online **2-3 days a week** and solve the questions.

Sometimes it took us 1 hour to analyze 5 questions. We would copy the question to IntelliJ, look at various variations, review the relevant Java documentation and discuss alternative questions and solution methods. I have experienced that following this kind of working method is very useful in terms of comprehending the subject in detail.

I also started writing summaries of the book in a notebook and completed the summaries in about **45 days**. It became easier for me to revise on the train, on the bus, and at home.

I needed additional questions to test the information I had digested. Again, the question bank prepared by **Scott Selikoff** and **Jeanne Boyarsky** with **1000 questions** and **3 practice tests** came to my rescue.

Within 10 days, I solved all the questions and carefully read the answer key with explanations for the questions I got wrong.

I scheduled the exam date for the following week via [Oracle Education website](https://education.oracle.com/Certification). Unfortunately, Oracle’s website is not very user-friendly and I will list the steps I followed under a separate heading for your convenience.

During the time until the exam date, I solved **3 practice exams** in the question bank by keeping time (90 min.). However, the percentage of correct answers was between **60–70%** and did not satisfy me. Because it was necessary to pass the **68% threshold** in the real exam. In order not to risk the exam fee, I postponed the exam date for a week and searched for additional resources.

I read the comments and recommendations on [coderanch](https://coderanch.com/), a website run by **Jeanne Boyarsky**, and was advised by a software developer who had passed the exam that the questions on the [Enthuware website](https://enthuware.com/java-certification-mock-exams/oracle-certified-professional/ocp-java-17-exam-1z0-829) were close to the difficulty level of the real exam. I immediately purchased access to the online question bank and solved a practice exam every day for the next week.

Enthuware Practice Tests

After the first few practice tests, my speed of solving the questions had increased and my percentage of correct answers was over 70%. Now I was ready to take the exam ;)

## 3- Technical preparations before the exam

Once you have booked the exam date and time, you will receive the following confirmation email. You can start the technical qualification tests of your computer by clicking on the **Your computer** link in this e-mail. In short, there is a browser qualification test along with camera and microphone tests via **Zoom**.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:933/1*s8B5KPW6MAHGv10p6BzXQQ.png)

Confirmation e-mail of the date and time of the exam

**Half an hour** before the exam start time, you connect to the system by pressing the **Start Exam** button in the confirmation e-mail you receive. First of all, you are requested to install **Secure Browser** via a link shown on the screen. Therefore, **it is very important** that you have **Admin authorization** on the laptop/desktop computer where you will take the exam.

You need to have a document such as an official ID card, driver’s license, etc. with you to be shown when requested. In addition, it is against the exam rules to have anything other than a laptop (paper, notebook, book, etc.) on the desk. You may also be asked to show your desk layout and the room where you will take the exam.

After installing Secure Browser, you connect to Zoom via the link sent to you. You can see the proctors and other candidates here. The proctor sends you a **6-digit access code** via Zoom chat. You enter this code on the exam screen and start the exam.

## 4- Exam day: Advice, tips, strategies…

The exam duration is **90 minutes**. When you start the exam, you can see the remaining time on the screen. There are **50 questions** in total and the threshold score is **68%**. However, in the final report, I was informed that **5 questions** were included for **testing purposes** and my exam score was calculated over **45 questions**.

I later found out that this is how Oracle prepares the questions it plans to ask in future exams. As a result, you will solve all 50 questions with the same seriousness since you do not know which questions are included for testing purposes. If you answer **31 out of 45 questions** correctly, you are **eligible for the certificate**.

**It is very important to skip the questions that you think may waste your time** because you have less than 2 minutes for each question and you are racing against time. Two of the first five questions seemed complicated to me at first glance and I did not want to waste my time. I marked those questions and continued with the others. I also marked one or two questions in the middle of the exam in this way.

If you allocate, for example, 5 minutes for such questions, the time pressure may cause you to panic as there will be less time left for the next questions and you may give incorrect answers to questions that you can answer easily.

**Do not overdo skipping questions**. Skipping too many questions can also stress you out. The ideal number is debatable, but I think it should not exceed 10. Personally, I marked 5 questions and completed the other questions in 80 minutes. In the remaining time, I went back to these questions and tried to make my best guesses.

**Answer all the questions.** For the questions you are not sure of the answer to, look at the options and try to choose the most logical option. Because the wrong answer does not take away the right answer and your total score is calculated based on the _number of correct answers/total number of questions_.

**First, read the question and answer options and then start analyzing the code.** In some questions, there are options such as “Compiler gives error”, and “Throws Exception” (I think there were around 10–15 questions). If these are in the options, you need to check whether there is a piece of code that can give a Compiler error or throw an Exception in Runtime before looking at the result produced by the code. If these are not in the options and you started reading the code directly with these checks, then your 30–60 seconds were wasted.

**Do not overlook questions with more than one correct answer.** Some questions require 2–3 correct answers to be marked. Due to the excitement of the exam and fast reading, there is a possibility of forgetting to mark the other correct options. In such a case, you answer the question incorrectly. A small detail that may help you; in such questions, the options are in the form of a “**checkbox**”, while in questions where only one correct answer is expected, they are in the form of a “**radio button**”.

So far I have tried to share with you my experience in preparing for the exam as well as what to pay attention to during the exam.

To tell the truth, **the exam is difficult, but not impossible to pass**. The preparation time for the exam will vary according to one’s experience and the time one can spare. The preparation process, which took 6 months for me, might be shorter for you.

If you are new to learning Java, you should take the **Oracle Certified Professional: Java Foundations | 1Z0–811** instead of the _Java SE 17 Developer_ exam. It is more affordable and the topics covered are limited and basic.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:933/1*rfBFkY_6QxY11k8-sPwOpw.png)

Oracle Certified Professional: Java Foundations | 1Z0–811

Even if you do not take these exams, I strongly recommend reading the [_OCP Oracle Certified Professional Java SE 17 Developer Study Guide_](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/OCP+Oracle+Certified+Professional+Java+SE+17+Developer+Study+Guide%3A+Exam+1Z0+829-p-9781119864585). It will take your knowledge of Java and your ability to use the language to an advanced level.

I wish you success…
