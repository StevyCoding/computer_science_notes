## Summary: Creating Decision-Making Statements

This section discusses how to use Java operators to create decision-making statements, focusing on the `if` and `else` constructs, including the new pattern matching feature. The aim is to control program flow based on runtime conditions, allowing software behavior to adapt to varying inputs.

### Statements and Blocks
- **Java Statements:** A complete unit of execution terminated by a semicolon (`;`).
- **Control Flow Statements:** Break the execution flow through decision-making, looping, and branching. They can apply to single expressions or blocks of code, where a block is defined by balanced braces (`{}`).
  
**Example:**
- Single Statement: 
  ```java
  patrons++;
  ```
- Block of Code: 
  ```java
  {
      patrons++;
  }
  ```

Both can be targets of decision-making statements such as `if`.

### The if Statement
- The `if` statement executes a block of code if a boolean expression evaluates to `true`. 
- **Example:**
  ```java
  if(hourOfDay < 11) {
      System.out.println("Good Morning");
      morningGreetingCount++;
  }
  ```

**Indentation and Braces:** Be cautious with statements without braces. Misleading indentation can suggest that subsequent lines are part of the conditional execution, but in Java, only braces define the scope of an `if` statement.

### The else Statement
- The `else` statement allows for alternative code execution if the `if` condition is not met, improving code efficiency by evaluating the condition only once.
  
**Example:**
```java
if(hourOfDay < 11) {
    System.out.println("Good Morning");
} else {
    System.out.println("Good Afternoon");
}
```

You can further extend this with multiple `else if` statements for more complex conditions.

**Example with else if:**
```java
if(hourOfDay < 11) {
    System.out.println("Good Morning");
} else if(hourOfDay < 15) {
    System.out.println("Good Afternoon");
} else {
    System.out.println("Good Evening");
}
```

### Common Pitfalls
- **Boolean Expressions:** Ensure that the condition inside the `if` statement is a boolean expression. For example, using an integer directly will lead to a compile error.
  
**Invalid Example:**
```java
int hourOfDay = 1;
if(hourOfDay) {  // DOES NOT COMPILE
    …
}
```

In Java, only expressions evaluating to `true` or `false` are valid in `if` statements, contrasting with some other programming languages where non-boolean values can be used in conditionals.

### Conclusion
Understanding decision-making statements and control flow in Java is crucial for writing efficient and effective code. Mastery of these constructs will enhance your programming skills and prepare you for exam scenarios involving logical conditions.


##  Shortening Code with Pattern Matching

Java 16 introduced pattern matching with `if` statements and the `instanceof` operator, providing a streamlined approach for controlling program flow based on certain criteria. This technique reduces boilerplate code—repetitive patterns that clutter code and hinder readability.

### Understanding Pattern Matching
Pattern matching allows developers to avoid explicit type casting by declaring a pattern variable when checking a variable's type. For example, instead of first checking if a variable is of a specific type and then casting it, you can do it in one step:

```java
void compareIntegers(Number number) {
    if (number instanceof Integer data) {
        System.out.print(data.compareTo(5));
    }
}
```
Here, `data` is the pattern variable, which is only created if `number` is indeed an `Integer`. This approach eliminates the risk of `ClassCastException`.

### Reassigning Pattern Variables
Reassigning pattern variables is discouraged due to potential ambiguity. Attempting to reassign a pattern variable will result in a compilation error, reinforcing that pattern variables should remain final:

```java
if (number instanceof Integer data) {
    data = 10;  // DOES NOT COMPILE
}
```

### Using Pattern Variables in Expressions
Pattern matching can also filter data using expressions directly:

```java
void printIntegersGreaterThan5(Number number) {
    if (number instanceof Integer data && data.compareTo(5) > 0) {
        System.out.print(data);
    }
}
```
This example demonstrates how pattern variables can be leveraged to streamline conditional logic.

### Subtype Rules
The type of the pattern variable must be a strict subtype of the left-side variable. For instance, this code does not compile:

```java
Integer value = 123;
if (value instanceof Integer data) {}  // DOES NOT COMPILE
```

### Limitations of Subtype Enforcement
The compiler has some limitations on enforcing pattern matching types when we mix classes and interfaces, which will make more sense after you read Chapter 7, “Beyond Classes.” For example, given the non-final class Number and interface List, this does compile even though they are unrelated:
```java
    Number value = 123;
    if(value instanceof List) {}
    if(value instanceof List data) {}
```

### Flow Scoping
Flow scoping determines the visibility of pattern variables based on the compiler's ability to ascertain their type. For example:

```java
void printIntegersOrNumbersGreaterThan5(Number number) {
    if (number instanceof Integer data || data.compareTo(5) > 0) {
        System.out.print(data);  // DOES NOT COMPILE
    }
}
```
Here, `data` may not be defined if `number` is not an `Integer`, causing a compilation error.

However, a pattern variable can remain in scope under certain conditions:

```java
void printOnlyIntegers(Number number) { 
    if (!(number instanceof Integer data))
        return;
    System.out.print(data.intValue());
}
```
In this case, if the method reaches the print statement, the compiler confirms that `data` is defined and thus in scope.

### Conclusion
Understanding pattern matching and flow scoping is crucial for effective Java programming. By leveraging these features, developers can write cleaner, more maintainable code that adheres to modern best practices, significantly reducing boilerplate while enhancing clarity and efficiency.

## Applying Switch Statements in Java

When dealing with multiple branches for a single value, like printing a message based on the day of the week, using numerous `if-else` statements can lead to long and hard-to-read code. Instead, Java provides a cleaner solution with **switch statements** and **switch expressions**.

### The Switch Statement

- A **switch statement** evaluates a single value and redirects flow to the first matching **case** statement.
- If no case matches, an optional **default** statement can be executed. If neither is present, the switch is skipped entirely.
- Starting from Java 14, case values can be combined using commas, simplifying the code:
  ```java
  switch(animal) {
      case 1, 2: System.out.print("Lion");
      case 3: System.out.print("Tiger");
  }
  ```

- **Syntax Errors:** 
  - Missing parentheses around the switch variable.
  - Missing braces around the switch body.
  - Using a colon instead of a comma when combining case statements.

- Example of a switch statement for printing days of the week:
  ```java
  public void printDayOfWeek(int day) {
      switch(day) {
          case 0: System.out.print("Sunday"); break;
          case 1: System.out.print("Monday"); break;
          case 2: System.out.print("Tuesday"); break;
          case 3: System.out.print("Wednesday"); break;
          case 4: System.out.print("Thursday"); break;
          case 5: System.out.print("Friday"); break;
          case 6: System.out.print("Saturday"); break;
          default: System.out.print("Invalid value"); break;
      }
  }
  ```

- **Exiting with Break Statements:** 
  - `break` statements are optional but prevent fall-through behavior where all subsequent cases execute. Without them, executing a case statement may trigger all following cases.

### Selecting Switch Data Types

Switch statements can evaluate:
- Primitive types: `int`, `byte`, `short`, `char`
- Their wrapper classes: `Integer`, `Byte`, `Short`, `Character`
- Strings
- Enum values
- The `var` type if resolved to one of the above types

However, types like `boolean`, `long`, `float`, and `double` are not supported due to their range of values.

### Case Values in Switch Statements

- Case values must be compile-time constants and the same type as the switch variable. This means literals, enum constants, or `final` variables initialized with literal values are acceptable.
- Example of acceptable and unacceptable case values:
  ```java
  final int bananas = 1;
  int apples = 2; // Not final, so invalid in case
  switch(numberOfAnimals) {
      case bananas: // Valid
      case apples:  // Invalid
      case 3 * 5:   // Valid
  }
  ```

### The Switch Expression

Introduced in Java 14, the **switch expression** is a compact form of a switch statement that can return values, simplifying syntax:
```java
public void printDayOfWeek(int day) {
    var result = switch(day) {
        case 0 -> "Sunday";
        case 1 -> "Monday";
        case 2 -> "Tuesday";
        case 3 -> "Wednesday";
        case 4 -> "Thursday";
        case 5 -> "Friday";
        case 6 -> "Saturday";
        default -> "Invalid value";
    };
    System.out.print(result);
}
```

- Each case expression requires a semicolon, and multiple case values can still be combined.
- The switch expression must maintain consistent data types across branches, and all branches must yield a value if it's meant to return one.

By using switch statements and expressions, code becomes more concise, readable, and maintainable, especially when dealing with numerous possible branches based on a single variable.

## Summary: Working with `for` Loops

Most `for` loops in development are straightforward, but exams may feature variations and edge cases. Here are five examples to know:

1. **Infinite Loop**  
   ```java
   for( ; ; ) 
      System.out.println("Hello World");
   ```
   This loop compiles and runs endlessly, showing that `for` components are optional, though semicolons are required.

2. **Multiple Terms in a Loop**  
   ```java
   int x = 0;
   for (long y = 0, z = 4; x < 5 && y < 10; x++, y++)
      System.out.print(y + " ");
   System.out.print(x + " ");
   ```
   This example demonstrates that variables can be declared before or inside the loop. Unused variables (like `z`) are allowed, and the update section can modify multiple variables.

3. **Redeclaring Variables**  
   ```java
   int x = 0;
   for (int x = 4; x < 5; x++)  // DOES NOT COMPILE
      System.out.print(x + " ");
   ```
   The above code won’t compile since `x` is declared both before and inside the loop. Removing the second declaration fixes the issue.

4. **Incompatible Data Types**  
   ```java
   for (long y = 0, int z = 4; x < 5; x++)  // DOES NOT COMPILE
      System.out.print(y + " ");
   ```
   All variables in the initialization block must share the same type; mixing types (like `long` and `int`) causes a compilation error.

5. **Using Loop Variables Outside Scope**  
   ```java
   for (long y = 0, x = 4; x < 5 && y < 10; x++, y++)
      System.out.print(y + " ");
   System.out.print(x);  // DOES NOT COMPILE
   ```
   Variables declared in the loop’s initialization block are scoped to the loop and cannot be accessed after it ends.

6. **Modifying Loop Variables**  
   ```java
   for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) 
      i = 0;

   for (int j = 1; j < 10; j++) 
      j++;
   ```
   Altering loop variables inside the loop can lead to unpredictable behavior and should generally be avoided, as it makes code harder to understand.


## Summary: The for-each Loop  

The for-each loop is a concise way to iterate over arrays and collections that implement `Iterable`. Its purpose is to simplify code by removing the need for manual counters, making it easier to read and maintain.

- **Structure:**  
  The right side of the loop must be either a Java array or an object implementing `Iterable` (e.g., `List`, `Set`). Not all collections are supported; for example, `Map` cannot be directly used in a for-each loop but provides methods that return collections.

- **Syntax Example:**
  ```java
  public void printNames(String[] names) {
      for (var name : names) 
          System.out.println(name);
  }
  ```
  This method is more concise than the traditional for loop, eliminating the need for counter variables.

- **Compatibility:**  
  The left side must declare a variable of the same type as the elements being iterated. On each iteration, the variable is assigned the next element from the array or collection.

- **Example with List:**
  ```java
  public void printNames(List<String> names) {
      for (var name : names) 
          System.out.println(name);
  }
  ```

- **Invalid Cases:**
  1. **Using a non-iterable object:**  
     ```java
     String birds = "Jay";
     for (String bird : birds)  // DOES NOT COMPILE
         System.out.print(bird + " ");
     ```
     A `String` is not iterable, even though it represents a sequence of characters.

  2. **Type mismatch:**  
     ```java
     String[] sloths = new String[3];
     for (int sloth : sloths)  // DOES NOT COMPILE
         System.out.print(sloth + " ");
     ```
     The loop variable type (`int`) does not match the array's element type (`String`).

The for-each loop reduces boilerplate code, making it a preferred choice when working with arrays and collections.

The for-each loop streamlines iteration by reducing boilerplate code, making it a popular choice for working with arrays and collections.

## The break Statement  

A `break` statement exits from the nearest loop or switch statement it is currently executing. It can also use an **optional label** to break out of an outer loop.  

### Example: Breaking a Nested Loop with a Label  
```java
public class FindInMatrix {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] list = {{1, 13}, {5, 2}, {2, 2}};
        int searchValue = 2;
        int positionX = -1, positionY = -1;

        PARENT_LOOP: for (int i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < list[i].length; j++) {
                if (list[i][j] == searchValue) {
                    positionX = i;
                    positionY = j;
                    break PARENT_LOOP;
                }
            }
        }
        if (positionX == -1 || positionY == -1) {
            System.out.println("Value " + searchValue + " not found");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Value " + searchValue + " found at: (" + positionX + "," + positionY + ")");
        }
    }
}
```
**Output:**  
```
Value 2 found at: (1,1)
```
Using `break PARENT_LOOP` exits the outer loop as soon as the value is found. If we only used `break`, it would exit just the inner loop, potentially producing different results.  

**Modified Inner Loop Example:**  
```java
if (list[i][j] == searchValue) {
    positionX = i;
    positionY = j;
    break;
}
```
**Output:**  
```
Value 2 found at: (2,0)
```
Removing the `break` entirely would result in the search finding the last matching value:  
**Output:**  
```
Value 2 found at: (2,1)
```

---

## The continue Statement  

A `continue` statement skips the current iteration of a loop and proceeds to the next. Like `break`, it can optionally use a **label** to specify which loop to affect.  

### Example: Using `continue` with a Label  
```java
public class CleaningSchedule {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CLEANING: for (char stable = 'a'; stable <= 'd'; stable++) {
            for (int leopard = 1; leopard < 4; leopard++) {
                if (stable == 'b' || leopard == 2) {
                    continue CLEANING;
                }
                System.out.println("Cleaning: " + stable + "," + leopard);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
**Output:**  
```
Cleaning: a,1  
Cleaning: c,1  
Cleaning: d,1
```
Here, the `continue CLEANING;` skips to the next iteration of the outer loop when `stable == 'b'` or `leopard == 2`.

### Example: Without a Label  
```java
if (stable == 'b' || leopard == 2) {
    continue;
}
```
**Output:**  
```
Cleaning: a,1  
Cleaning: a,3  
Cleaning: c,1  
Cleaning: c,3  
Cleaning: d,1  
Cleaning: d,3
```
This version skips only the current inner loop iteration.

### Example: Without `continue`  
Removing the `continue` statement would result in printing every combination:  
**Output:**  
```
Cleaning: a,1  
Cleaning: a,2  
Cleaning: a,3  
Cleaning: b,1  
Cleaning: b,2  
Cleaning: b,3  
Cleaning: c,1  
Cleaning: c,2  
Cleaning: c,3  
Cleaning: d,1  
Cleaning: d,2  
Cleaning: d,3
```  

These examples demonstrate how `break` and `continue` with or without labels can significantly affect loop behavior.

## Summary: The `return` Statement and Unreachable Code in Java

#### The `return` Statement  
The `return` statement is primarily used to exit from a method and return a value (or nothing in the case of `void` methods). It can also be a cleaner alternative to using labels and `break` statements for terminating loops or nested structures. Here's a key example of using `return` to exit nested loops:  

**Example: Using `return` to Replace `break` in Nested Loops**
```java
public class FindInMatrixUsingReturn {
   private static int[] searchForValue(int[][] list, int v) {
      for (int i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {
         for (int j = 0; j < list[i].length; j++) {
            if (list[i][j] == v) {
               return new int[] {i, j};  // Exit immediately when found
            }
         }
      }
      return null;  // Value not found
   }

   public static void main(String[] args) {
      int[][] list = {{1, 13}, {5, 2}, {2, 2}};
      int searchValue = 2;
      int[] results = searchForValue(list, searchValue);

      if (results == null) {
         System.out.println("Value " + searchValue + " not found");
      } else {
         System.out.println("Value " + searchValue + " found at: (" + results[0] + "," + results[1] + ")");
      }
   }
}
```
This approach simplifies code by:
- Avoiding labels (`break` with labels can complicate readability).
- Making the loop logic independent in a method, improving **reusability** and **clarity** in the main logic.

While using `break` with labels is sometimes necessary for finer control, using `return` often leads to **cleaner and more readable code**.

---

### Unreachable Code
When using control statements like `break`, `continue`, or `return`, any code that follows them **within the same block** is considered **unreachable** by the compiler and will cause a compilation error.  

**Examples of Unreachable Code:**
1. **`break` example:**
   ```java
   int checkDate = 0;
   while (checkDate < 10) {
      checkDate++;
      if (checkDate > 100) {
         break;
         checkDate++;  // DOES NOT COMPILE (unreachable)
      }
   }
   ```

2. **`continue` example:**
   ```java
   int minute = 1;
   WATCH: while (minute > 2) {
      if (minute++ > 2) {
         continue WATCH;
         System.out.print(minute);  // DOES NOT COMPILE (unreachable)
      }
   }
   ```

3. **`return` example in `switch` statement:**
   ```java
   int hour = 2;
   switch (hour) {
      case 1: 
         return;
         hour++;  // DOES NOT COMPILE (unreachable)
      case 2:
   }
   ```

In all these cases, the compiler checks for unreachable code **statically**—even if it’s logically impossible for certain conditions to be met. If any code appears after `break`, `continue`, or `return`, it will not compile.

---

## Reviewing Branching

We conclude this section with Table 3.1, which will help remind you when labels, break, and continue statements are permitted in Java. Although for illustrative purposes our examples use these statements in nested loops, they can be used inside single loops as well.

### TABLE 3.1 Control Statement Usage

|                   | Support Labels | Support Break | Support Continue | Support Yield |
|-------------------|----------------|----------------|------------------|---------------|
| **while**         | Yes            | Yes            | Yes              | No            |
| **do/while**      | Yes            | Yes            | Yes              | No            |
| **for**           | Yes            | Yes            | Yes              | No            |
| **switch**        | Yes            | Yes            | No               | Yes           |

Last but not least, all testing centers should offer some form of scrap paper or dry-erase board to use during the exam. We strongly recommend you make use of these testing aids should you encounter complex questions involving nested loops and branching statements.

**Tip**: Some of the most time-consuming questions you may see on the exam could involve nested loops with lots of branching. Unless you spot an obvious compiler error, we recommend skipping these questions and coming back to them at the end. Remember, all questions on the exam are weighted evenly!

## Summary

This chapter presented how to make intelligent decisions in Java. We covered basic decision-making constructs such as if, else, and switch statements and showed how to use them to change the path of the process at runtime. We also presented newer features in the Java language, including pattern matching and switch expressions, both designed to reduce boilerplate code.

We then moved our discussion to repetition control structures, starting with while and do/while loops. We showed how to use them to create processes that loop multiple times and also emphasized the importance of ensuring they eventually terminate. Remember that most of these structures require the evaluation of a particular boolean expression to complete.

Next, we covered the extremely convenient repetition control structures: the for and for-each loops. While their syntax is more complex than the traditional while or do/while loops, they are extremely useful in everyday coding and allow you to create complex expressions in a single line of code. With a for-each loop, you don't need to explicitly write a boolean expression, as the compiler builds one for you. For clarity, we referred to an enhanced for loop as a for-each loop, but syntactically both are written using the for keyword.

We concluded this chapter by discussing advanced control options and how flow can be enhanced through nested loops coupled with break, continue, and return statements. Be wary of questions on the exam that use nested loops, especially ones with labels, and verify that they are being used correctly.

This chapter is especially important because at least one component of this chapter will likely appear in every exam question with sample code. Many of the questions on the exam focus on proper syntactic use of the structures, as they will be a large source of questions that end in “Does not compile.” You should be able to answer all of the review questions correctly or fully understand those that you answered incorrectly before moving on to later chapters.

## Exam Essentials

- **Understand if and else decision control statements**: The if and else statements come up frequently throughout the exam in questions unrelated to decision control, so make sure you fully understand these basic building blocks of Java.

- **Apply pattern matching and flow scoping**: Pattern matching can be used to reduce boilerplate code involving an if statement, instanceof operator, and cast operation using a pattern variable. It can also include a pattern or filter after the pattern variable declaration. Pattern matching uses flow scoping, where the pattern variable is in scope as long as the compiler can definitively determine its type.

- **Understand switch statements and their proper usage**: You should be able to spot a poorly formed switch statement on the exam. The switch value and data type should be compatible with the case statements, and the values for the case statements must evaluate to compile-time constants. Finally, at runtime, a switch statement branches to the first matching case or default if there is no match, or exits entirely if there is no match and no default branch. The process then continues into any proceeding case or default statements until a break or return statement is reached.

- **Use switch expressions correctly**: Discern the differences between switch expressions and switch statements. Understand how to write switch expressions correctly, including proper use of semicolons, writing case expressions and blocks that yield a consistent value, and ensuring all possible values of the switch variable are handled by the switch expression.

- **Write while loops**: Know the syntactical structure of all while and do/while loops. In particular, know when to use one versus the other.

- **Be able to use for loops**: You should be familiar with for and for-each loops and know how to write and evaluate them. Each loop has its own special properties and structures. You should know how to use for-each loops to iterate over lists and arrays.

- **Understand how break, continue, and return can change flow control**: Know how to change the flow control within a statement by applying a break, continue, or return statement. Also, know which control statements can accept break statements and which can accept continue statements. Finally, you should understand how these statements work inside embedded loops or switch statements.
