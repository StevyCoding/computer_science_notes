## Arrow Operator (`->`)  
The **arrow operator** is used in **lambda expressions** in Java to provide a concise way of expressing an anonymous function. It separates the parameter list from the body of the lambda.  

**Syntax:**  
```java
(parameters) -> expression
(parameters) -> { statements; }
```

- **Left side**: Parameters for the lambda expression.
- **Right side**: The logic or the expression to execute.

**Examples:**
1. **Single-line lambda expression:**
   ```java
   (a, b) -> a + b
   ```
   This lambda takes two parameters `a` and `b` and returns their sum.

2. **Multi-line lambda expression with a block:**
   ```java
   (x) -> {
       System.out.println("Value: " + x);
       return x * x;
   }
   ```
   Here, the lambda prints the input `x` and returns its square.

**Use case:**  
Lambda expressions are typically used with **functional interfaces** such as `Runnable`, `Comparator`, or `Function` to simplify the code, especially in **streams and collections processing**.

## Shift Operators (`<<`, `>>`, `>>>`)  
Shift operators are used to move bits left or right within a binary representation of a number. 

### Left Shift (`<<`)
- **Usage:** Shifts the bits of a number to the left by a specified number of positions.
- **Effect:** Multiplies the number by `2^n` (where `n` is the number of shifted positions).
- **Example:**
  ```java
  int a = 5;   // Binary: 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000101
  int result = a << 2;  // Shift left by 2 positions: 00000000 00000000 00000000 00010100
  System.out.println(result);  // Output: 20
  ```

### Right Shift (`>>`)
- **Usage:** Shifts the bits of a number to the right by a specified number of positions.
- **Effect:** Divides the number by `2^n`. The sign bit (leftmost bit) is preserved (for **signed numbers**), so negative numbers remain negative.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  int a = 20;  // Binary: 00000000 00000000 00000000 00010100
  int result = a >> 2;  // Shift right by 2 positions: 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000101
  System.out.println(result);  // Output: 5
  ```

### Unsigned Right Shift (`>>>`)
- **Usage:** Shifts the bits to the right, filling the leftmost bits with `0`, regardless of the sign of the number.
- **Effect:** This is useful for **unsigned** shifting, especially when working with large bit values.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  int a = -20;  // Binary: 11111111 11111111 11111111 11101100
  int result = a >>> 2;  // Unsigned shift right by 2: 00111111 11111111 11111111 11111011
  System.out.println(result);  // Output: 1073741819
  ```

---

### Summary of Shift Operators:
- **`<<`**: Shifts bits to the left (multiplies by 2^n).
- **`>>`**: Shifts bits to the right, keeping the sign intact (divides by 2^n).
- **`>>>`**: Shifts bits to the right without keeping the sign (fills with `0`).


## Numeric promotion Java

When performing arithmetic operations, Java automatically promotes numeric types based on specific rules to avoid data loss or overflow. Here's a quick overview:

### Numeric Promotion Rules:

1. **Promotion to the larger type:**  
    If two operands have different types, Java promotes the smaller type to the larger one (e.g., `int` â†’ `long`).
    
2. **Integral to floating-point promotion:**  
    If one operand is integral (e.g., `int`) and the other is floating-point (e.g., `double`), the integral value is promoted to the floating-point type.
    
3. **Small types promoted to `int`:**  
    The types `byte`, `short`, and `char` are always promoted to `int` in binary operations, even if no operand is of type `int`.
    
4. **Result type matches promoted operands:**  
    After promotion, the final result will have the same type as the promoted operands.
    

> **Note:** Unary operators (like `++`) are exceptions. For instance, applying `++` to a `short` still results in a `short`.

---

 **Examples:**

1. **`int` and `long` multiplication:**
    
    java
    
    Copy code
    
    `int x = 1; long y = 33; var z = x * y;  // Result: long`
    
    - `x` is promoted to `long`, and the result is `long`.
2. **Floating-point literal issue:**
    
    java
    
    Copy code
    
    `double x = 39.21; float y = 2.1f; var z = x + y;  // Result: double`
    
    - Both operands are promoted to `double`. The literal `2.1` must be written as `2.1f` to compile.
3. **`short` multiplication:**
    
    java
    
    Copy code
    
    `short x = 10; short y = 3; var z = x * y;  // Result: int`
    
    - Both `x` and `y` are promoted to `int`, and the result is `int`.
4. **Mixed-type arithmetic:**
    
    java
    
    Copy code
    
    `short w = 14; float x = 13; double y = 30; var z = w * x / y;  // Result: double`
    
    - `w` is promoted to `int`, then to `float` for multiplication with `x`. The intermediate result is promoted to `double` for division by `y`.

---

**Key Takeaways:**

- Be aware of **automatic type promotion** rules when working with arithmetic operations.
- Use **parentheses** to control the order of operations and type promotions.
- Always consider the **resulting data type** when assigning values to variables, as implicit casting may be required.

## Casting values

Casting is the explicit conversion of one data type into another, primarily used when assigning a larger type to a smaller one (narrowing). Without casting, trying to assign a larger type (like `double` to `int`) will cause a compile error. 

**Key Points:**  
- **Widening Conversion:** No cast needed (e.g., `int` to `long`).  
- **Narrowing Conversion:** Requires casting (e.g., `double` to `int`).  
- **Casting Syntax:** Place the target type in parentheses before the value (e.g., `(int) 1.0`).  
- **Overflow and Underflow:** When a value exceeds the range of a smaller data type, it wraps around (like in modulus arithmetic).  

**Example Errors:**  
1. **float egg = 2.0 / 9;** â€“ Cannot assign `double` to `float`.  
2. **int tadpole = (int) 5 * 2L;** â€“ Mixing `int` and `long` types without proper casting.  
3. **short frog = 3 - 2.0;** â€“ Arithmetic with `double` promotes the result to `double`.  

**Fixing Errors:**  
- **int fish = (int) 1.0;**  
- **short bird = (short) 1921222;** â€“ Results in overflow, stored as 20678.  
- **long reptile = 192301398193810323L;** â€“ Add `L` to indicate `long`.  

**Numeric Promotions:**  
When performing arithmetic, smaller types (like `short`) are automatically promoted to `int`. For example, the following will not compile:

```java
short mouse = 10;
short hamster = 3;
short capybara = mouse * hamster;  // Error: result is int
```
Solution: Cast the result back to `short`:
```java
short capybara = (short) (mouse * hamster);
```

**Casting Values vs. Variables:**  
- Literal values fitting within a data type donâ€™t need casting (e.g., `byte hat = 1;`).  
- However, arithmetic with variables promotes the result to `int`, causing errors unless explicitly cast.  

Understanding casting helps manage type conversions, handle numeric promotion, and prevent overflow or underflow issues in Java.


## Compound Assignment Operators


In addition to the simple assignment operator (`=`), Java provides **compound assignment operators** that combine arithmetic or logical operations with assignment. These operators modify the value of a variable and assign the result back to it.

### Common Compound Operators:

| **Operator** | **Example**   | **Description**                                 |
|--------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `+=`         | `a += 5`      | Adds the right value to the variable on the left |
| `-=`         | `b -= 0.2`    | Subtracts the right value from the left variable |
| `*=`         | `c *= 100`    | Multiplies the left variable by the right value |
| `/=`         | `d /= 4`      | Divides the left variable by the right value |

### How They Work:
- Compound operators are shorthand for performing an operation and assignment in one step:
  ```java
  int camel = 2, giraffe = 3;
  camel = camel * giraffe;   // Simple assignment
  camel *= giraffe;          // Equivalent compound assignment
  ```

- **Note:** The left side of a compound assignment must reference an **existing variable**â€”you cannot use it to declare a new one.

### Handling Type Casting with Compound Operators:
Using compound operators can help **avoid explicit type casting**. For example:
```java
long goat = 10;
int sheep = 5;
sheep = sheep * goat;   // DOES NOT COMPILE (assigning long to int)
```

- In this case, the compiler reports an error because it tries to assign a `long` value to an `int`. You could fix this by explicitly casting, but using a compound operator is simpler:
  ```java
  sheep *= goat;  // Works correctly
  ```
  - **How it works:**  
    The operator temporarily promotes `sheep` to `long` for the multiplication, and then casts the result back to `int`.

**Key Takeaway:**
Compound assignment operators not only provide a concise way to write code but also handle **implicit type casting**, preventing errors that would occur with regular assignments.

## Compartin value 

Equality operators are used to **compare values** to check if they are the same or different. These operators return a **boolean** result and are essential for both primitive and object comparisons.

### Equality Operators Overview:

| **Operator** | **Example** | **Primitives**                   | **Objects**                                       |
| ------------ | ----------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `==`         | `a == 10`   | True if the values are equal     | True if both references point to the same object  |
| `!=`         | `b != 3.14` | True if the values are not equal | True if the references point to different objects |
|              |             |                                  |                                                   |

### Key Rules:
- The equality operators (`==` and `!=`) can be applied to **numeric values, booleans, and objects**.  
- You **cannot mix data types** when using equality operators, or it will result in a **compiler error**:
  ```java
  boolean monkey = true == 3;   // DOES NOT COMPILE
  boolean ape = false != "Grape";   // DOES NOT COMPILE
  ```

### Beware of Assignment vs. Equality:
- The exam may confuse **assignment (`=`)** with equality (`==`).  
  Example:
  ```java
  boolean bear = false;
  boolean polar = (bear = true);  // Assigns true to bear
  System.out.println(polar);      // Output: true
  ```
  - Here, `(bear = true)` assigns the value `true` to `bear`, which makes `polar` also `true`. This is different from `bear == true`, which would compare values.

### Object Comparison:
- The equality operator (`==`) for **objects compares references**, not the content. Two references are only equal if they point to the **same object** or both are `null`.
  ```java
  var monday = new File("schedule.txt");
  var tuesday = new File("schedule.txt");
  var wednesday = tuesday;

  System.out.println(monday == tuesday);    // false
  System.out.println(tuesday == wednesday); // true
  ```
  - Even though both `monday` and `tuesday` reference files with the same data, they are distinct objects since each was created with `new`.

#### **Null Comparisons:**
- In Java, `null` can be compared with another `null`, and the result will be `true`:
  ```java
  System.out.print(null == null);  // true
  ```

### Future Topics:
- Later chapters will explore **object equivalence**, including the nuances of **String equality**, which goes beyond basic reference comparison.

### Summary: Relational Operators in Java

Relational operators **compare two expressions** and return a **boolean** result. They help determine the relationship between values, such as which is greater or whether a reference matches a specific type.

### Relational Operators Overview:

| **Operator**                   | **Example**           | **Description**                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<`  (Less than)               | `a < 5`               | True if the value on the left is **strictly less** than the value on the right                            |
| `<=` (Less than or equal)      | `b <= 6`              | True if the value on the left is **less than or equal** to the value on the right                         |
| `>`  (Greater than)            | `c > 9`               | True if the value on the left is **strictly greater** than the value on the right                         |
| `>=` (Greater than or equal)   | `3 >= d`              | True if the value on the left is **greater than or equal** to the value on the right                      |
| `instanceof` (Type comparison) | `e instanceof String` | True if the reference on the left is an **instance of** the specified type (class, interface, enum, etc.) |

### Key Points:
- **Numeric Comparisons:** Relational operators like `<`, `<=`, `>`, and `>=` are used for **comparing numbers**.
- **Type Comparison:** The `instanceof` operator checks if a reference **matches a specific type** (e.g., class or interface).
  ```java
  String name = "Java";
  System.out.println(name instanceof String);  // true
  ```
- These operators are essential for **conditional logic** and flow control within Java programs.



## Relational Operators in Java

Relational operators **compare two expressions** and return a **boolean** result, while numeric comparison operators specifically apply to **numeric values**. Understanding these operators is crucial for effective Java programming.

### Relational Operators Overview:

| **Operator**              | **Example**  | **Description**                                                      |
|---------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `<`  (Less than)           | `a < 5`      | Returns true if the value on the left is **strictly less** than the value on the right |
| `<=` (Less than or equal)  | `b <= 6`     | Returns true if the value on the left is **less than or equal** to the value on the right |
| `>`  (Greater than)        | `c > 9`      | Returns true if the value on the left is **strictly greater** than the value on the right |
| `>=` (Greater than or equal) | `3 >= d`  | Returns true if the value on the left is **greater than or equal** to the value on the right |
| `instanceof` (Type comparison) | `e instanceof String` | Returns true if the reference on the left is an **instance of** the specified type (class, interface, etc.) |

### Numeric Comparison Operators:
The first four relational operators apply only to **numeric values**. If the operands differ in data type, the smaller one is promoted. 

**Example:**
```java
int gibbonNumFeet = 2, wolfNumFeet = 4, ostrichNumFeet = 2;
System.out.println(gibbonNumFeet < wolfNumFeet); // true
System.out.println(gibbonNumFeet <= wolfNumFeet); // true
System.out.println(gibbonNumFeet >= ostrichNumFeet); // true
System.out.println(gibbonNumFeet > ostrichNumFeet); // false
```
In the last example, although `gibbonNumFeet` and `ostrichNumFeet` have the same value, `gibbonNumFeet` is not **strictly greater**.

### instanceof Operator:
The `instanceof` operator is vital for determining if an object belongs to a specific class or interface at runtime. 

**Example of Polymorphism:**
```java
public void openZoo(Number time) {
    if (time instanceof Integer)
        System.out.print((Integer)time + " O'clock");
    else
        System.out.print(time);
}
```
In this method, `instanceof` allows for intelligent handling of different numeric types.

### Important Notes:
- **Casting:** Itâ€™s common to use casting after checking with `instanceof` to access specific fields of a class.
- **Invalid Use:** `instanceof` cannot be used with incompatible types, leading to compilation errors.
- **Null Handling:** Using `instanceof` on a null variable returns **false**.
    ```java
    System.out.print(null instanceof Object);  // false

**In Summary:** Understanding relational and numeric comparison operators, especially the `instanceof` operator, enhances your ability to manage data types and polymorphism effectively in Java.


## Summary: Logical Operators in Java

Logical operators are fundamental in computer science, used to perform operations on boolean values. They also apply to numeric types, functioning as bitwise operators. This section focuses on logical operations relevant for boolean data types, which are essential for control flow in Java programming.

### Logical Operators Overview:

| **Operator**               | **Example**              | **Description**                                                          |     |                                                       |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `&` (Logical AND)          | `a & b`                  | The result is true only if **both values** are true.                     |     |                                                       |
| `                          | ` (Logical inclusive OR) | `c                                                                       | d`  | The result is true if **at least one value** is true. |
| `^` (Logical exclusive OR) | `e ^ f`                  | The result is true only if **one value** is true and the other is false. |     |                                                       |

**Truth Tables:**

- **AND (`&`)**: True only if both operands are true.
- **Inclusive OR (`|`)**: True if at least one operand is true; false only if both are false.
- **Exclusive OR (`^`)**: True only if operands are different.

###  Example Usage:

```java
boolean eyesClosed = true;
boolean breathingSlowly = true;

boolean resting = eyesClosed | breathingSlowly; // true
boolean asleep = eyesClosed & breathingSlowly;   // true
boolean awake = eyesClosed ^ breathingSlowly;    // false

System.out.println(resting);  // true
System.out.println(asleep);   // true
System.out.println(awake);    // false
```

### Key Tips for Remembering Logical Operators:
- **AND** (`&`): Only true when both operands are true.
- **Inclusive OR** (`|`): Only false when both operands are false.
- **Exclusive OR** (`^`): Only true when the operands differ.

**Practical Exercise:** Experiment with the values of `eyesClosed` and `breathingSlowly` to see how different combinations affect the outcomes of `resting`, `asleep`, and `awake`. Understanding how these operators work will enhance your control flow logic in Java applications.



## Summary: Conditional Operators in Java

Conditional operators are crucial for control flow in Java, allowing you to create efficient boolean expressions that can short-circuit evaluation. They are particularly useful in scenarios where you want to avoid unnecessary computations or prevent exceptions.

### Conditional Operators Overview:

| Operator           | Example    | Description                                                                                  |
|--------------------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `&&` (Conditional AND) | `a && b`   | The result is true only if **both values** are true. If the left side is false, the right side is not evaluated.  |
| `||` (Conditional OR)  | `c || d`   | The result is true if **at least one value** is true. If the left side is true, the right side is not evaluated. |

**Key Characteristics:**
- Conditional operators are known as **short-circuit operators** because they can skip evaluating the right side if the left side provides sufficient information to determine the outcome.

### Example Usage:

```java
int hour = 10;
boolean zooOpen = true || (hour < 4);
System.out.println(zooOpen);  // true
```
In this example, the right side (`hour < 4`) is not evaluated because the left side (`true`) already determines the result.

### Avoiding NullPointerException:

Conditional operators are commonly used to check for null objects to prevent runtime exceptions. 

**Example:**
```java
if(duck != null && duck.getAge() < 5) {
   // Do something
}
```
In this case, if `duck` is null, the second condition (`duck.getAge() < 5`) is never evaluated, avoiding a `NullPointerException`.

### Unperformed Side Effects:

Be cautious with short-circuit behavior, especially when the right side of the expression contains operations that may not be executed:

**Example:**
```java
int rabbit = 6;
boolean bunny = (rabbit >= 6) || (++rabbit <= 7);
System.out.println(rabbit);  // Output: 6
```
Here, `rabbit >= 6` is true, so the increment operation (`++rabbit`) on the right side is never evaluated, leaving `rabbit` unchanged.

### Conclusion:
Understanding conditional operators is vital for writing robust Java programs. They help manage boolean logic effectively while enhancing performance by preventing unnecessary evaluations.

##  Making Decisions with the Ternary Operator

The ternary operator (`? :`) is a concise way to perform conditional evaluations in Java, allowing you to return values based on a boolean expression. It is the only operator that takes three operands, which makes it unique in its functionality.

### Ternary Operator Syntax:

The ternary operator is structured as follows:

```
booleanExpression ? expression1 : expression2
```

- **booleanExpression**: A condition that evaluates to `true` or `false`.
- **expression1**: The value returned if the boolean expression is `true`.
- **expression2**: The value returned if the boolean expression is `false`.

### Example:

Consider the following code that calculates the food amount for an owl:

```java
int owl = 5;
int food;
if (owl < 2) {
    food = 3;
} else {
    food = 4;
}
System.out.println(food);  // Output: 4
```

Using the ternary operator, this can be rewritten as:

```java
int owl = 5;
int food = owl < 2 ? 3 : 4;
System.out.println(food);  // Output: 4
```

### Readability with Multiple Ternary Operators:

While you can nest ternary operators, it can quickly become difficult to read. Consider these two equivalent expressions:

```java
int food1 = owl < 4 ? owl > 2 ? 3 : 4 : 5;
int food2 = (owl < 4 ? ((owl > 2) ? 3 : 4) : 5);
```

The second expression, `food2`, is more readable due to the added parentheses.

### Type Compatibility:

The second and third expressions in a ternary operation do not need to be of the same data type, but this becomes important when using the result in an assignment. For instance:

```java
int stripes = 7;

System.out.print((stripes > 5) ? 21 : "Zebra");  // Compiles
int animal = (stripes < 9) ? 3 : "Horse";        // DOES NOT COMPILE
```

The first expression compiles because `System.out.print()` can accept different types, while the second expression fails because it attempts to assign a `String` to an `int`.

### Unperformed Side Effects:

Similar to conditional operators, a ternary expression can also lead to unperformed side effects since only one of the expressions on the right side will be evaluated:

**Example 1:**

```java
int sheep = 1;
int zzz = 1;
int sleep = zzz < 10 ? sheep++ : zzz++;
System.out.print(sheep + "," + zzz);  // Output: 2, 1
```

In this case, since `zzz < 10` is `true`, `sheep` is incremented.

**Example 2:**

```java
int sheep = 1;
int zzz = 1;
int sleep = sheep >= 10 ? sheep++ : zzz++;
System.out.print(sheep + "," + zzz);  // Output: 1, 2
```

Here, since `sheep >= 10` is `false`, `zzz` is incremented.

### Conclusion:

When using the ternary operator, be mindful of readability and type compatibility. It is a powerful tool for making quick conditional decisions in your code, but it can introduce complexity if not used carefully, especially with potential unperformed side effects.
