# Implementing Interfaces

An interface in Java is a reference type that allows you to define a contract that classes can implement. Here are the main characteristics of an interface:

1. **Abstract Methods**: Interfaces typically contain abstract methods (methods without a body). Any class that implements the interface must provide an implementation for these methods, making it a way to enforce specific behaviors across multiple classes.
    
2. **Multiple Inheritance**: Java doesn’t support multiple inheritance for classes, but a class can implement multiple interfaces. This provides a way to achieve multiple inheritance-like behavior in Java.
    
3. **Constants**: All fields in an interface are implicitly `public`, `static`, and `final`, meaning they are constants and can’t be changed.
    
4. **Default and Static Methods**: Starting with Java 8, interfaces can have `default` and `static` methods with an actual method body. `Default` methods allow you to provide a standard implementation, which implementing classes can choose to override.
    
5. **Polymorphism**: Interfaces allow for polymorphic behavior. Since a class can implement multiple interfaces, objects can be treated as any of the interface types it implements, making interfaces a powerful tool for building flexible and scalable systems.
    

In summary, an interface defines a set of methods that a class must implement, providing
 flexibility, enabling multiple inheritance, and enforcing specific behaviors across classes.


|Membership type|Required modifiers|Implicit modifiers|Has value or body?|
|---|---|---|---|
|Constant variable|Class|—|`public`  <br>`static`  <br>`final`|Yes|
|`abstract` method|Instance|—|`public`  <br>`abstract`|No|
|`default` method|Instance|`default`|`public`|Yes|
|`static` method|Class|`static`|`public`|Yes|
|`private` method|Instance|`private`|—|Yes|
|`private static` method|Class|`private`  <br>`static`|—|Yes|


# Working With Enums

In programming, it is common to have a type that can only have a finite set of values, such as days of the week, seasons of the year, primary colors, and so on. An _enumeration_, or _enum_ for short, is like a fixed set of constants.

Using an enum is much better than using a bunch of constants because it provides type-safe checking. With numeric or `String` constants, you can pass an invalid value and not find out until runtime. With enums, it is impossible to create an invalid enum value without introducing a compiler error.

Enumerations show up whenever you have a set of items whose types are known at compile time. Common examples include the compass directions, the months of the year, the planets in the solar system, and the cards in a deck (well, maybe not the planets in a solar system, given that Pluto had its planetary status revoked).

## Creating Enums

```java
public enum Season {
WINTER, SPRING, SUMMER, FALL;
}
```

Using the enum is easy 

```java
var s = Season.SUMMER;
System.out.println(Season.SUMMER);      // SUMMER
System.out.println(s == Season.SUMMER); // true
```

- value in the Enum are fixed can' b eextended

###  Enum methods

```java
Season.values()
Season.valueOf(String p)
```

### using Enums in switch statement


```java
Season summer = Season.SUMMER;
switch(summer) {
   case WINTER:
      System.out.print("Get out the sled!");
      break;
   case SUMMER:
      System.out.print("Time for the pool!");
      break;
   default:
      System.out.print("Is it summer yet?");
}
```

### Adding Constructors, Fields, and Method

```java
1: public enum Season {
2:    WINTER("Low"), SPRING("Medium"), SUMMER("High"), FALL("Medium");
3:    private final String expectedVisitors;
4:    private Season(String expectedVisitors) {
5:       this.expectedVisitors = expectedVisitors;
6:    }
7:    public void printExpectedVisitors() {
8:       System.out.println(expectedVisitors);
9:    } }
```

What about the parentheses on line 2? Those are constructor calls, but without the `new` keyword normally used for objects. The first time we ask for any of the enum values, Java constructs all of the enum values. After that, Java just returns the already constructed enum values. Given that explanation, you can see why this calls the constructor only once:

```java
public enum OnlyOne {
   ONCE(true);
   private OnlyOne(boolean b) {
      System.out.print("constructing,");
   }
}
 
public class PrintTheOne {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      System.out.print("begin,");
      OnlyOne firstCall = OnlyOne.ONCE;   // Prints constructing,
      OnlyOne secondCall = OnlyOne.ONCE;  // Doesn't print anything
      System.out.print("end");
   }
}
```

# Sealing Class
![[Pasted image 20241029232658.png]]

**Sealed Class Keywords**

- **`sealed`**: Indicates that a class or interface may only be extended/implemented by named classes or interfaces
- `permits`: Used with the `sealed` keyword to list the classes and interfaces allowed
- **`non-sealed`: Applied to a class or interface that extends a sealed class, indicating that it can be extended by unspecified classes

### Specifying the Subclass Modifier

While some types, like interfaces, have a certain number of implicit modifiers, sealed classes do not. _Every class that directly extends a sealed class must specify exactly one of the following three modifiers_: `final`, `sealed`, or `non-sealed`. Remember this rule for the exam!

```java
public sealed class Antelope permits Gazelle {} 
 
public final class Gazelle extends Antelope {}
 
public class George extends Gazelle {} // DOES NOT COMPILE
```


### Referencing Nested Subclasses

```java
   public sealed class Snake permits Snake.Cobra {
       final class Cobra extends Snake {}
    }
```

## Encapsulating Data with Records

A _POJO_, which stands for Plain Old Java Object, is a class used to model and pass data around, often with few or no complex methods (hence the “plain” part of the definition). You might have also heard of a JavaBean, which is POJO that has some additional rules applied.

### Applying Records
![[Pasted image 20241031124442.png]]

**Members Automatically Added to Records**

- **Constructor**: A constructor with the parameters in the same order as the record declaration
- **Accessor method**: One accessor for each field
- **`equals()`**: A method to compare two elements that returns `true` if each field is equal in terms of `equals()`
- **`hashCode()`**: A consistent `hashCode()` method using all of the fields
- **`toString()`**: A `toString()` implementation that prints each field of the record in a convenient, easy-to-read format

### Understanding Record Immutability

As you saw, records don't have setters. Every field is inherently `final` and cannot be modified after it has been written in the constructor. In order to “modify” a record, you have to make a new object and copy all of the data you want to preserve.

*Just as interfaces are implicitly `abstract`, records are also implicitly `final`. The `final` modifier is optional but assumed.*

Like enums, that means you can't extend or inherit a record.

```java
public record BlueCrane() extends Crane {} // DOES NOT COMPILE
```

Also like enums, a record can implement a regular or sealed interface, provided it implements all of the abstract methods.

```java
public interface Bird {}
public record Crane(int numberEggs, String name) implements Bird {}
```

### Declaring Constructors

#### The Long Constructor

First, we can just declare the constructor the compiler normally inserts automatically, which we refer to as the _long constructor_.

```java
public record Crane(int numberEggs, String name) {
   public Crane(int numberEggs, String name) {
      if (numberEggs < 0) throw new IllegalArgumentException();
      this.numberEggs = numberEggs;
      this.name = name;
   }
}
```

The compiler will not insert a constructor if you define one with the same list of parameters in the same order. Since each field is `final`, the constructor must set every field. For example, this record does not compile:

```java
public record Crane(int numberEggs, String name) {
   public Crane(int numberEggs, String name) {} // DOES NOT COMPILE
}
```

#### Compact Constructors

Luckily, the authors of Java added the ability to define a compact constructor for records. A _compact constructor_ is a special type of constructor used for records to process validation and transformations succinctly. It takes no parameters and implicitly sets all fields. [Figure 7.7](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ocp-oracle-certified/9781119864585/c07.xhtml#c07-fig-0007) shows an example of a compact constructor.

![[Pasted image 20241031125811.png]]


While compact constructors can modify the constructor parameters, _they cannot modify the fields of the record_. For example, this does not compile:

```java
public record Crane(int numberEggs, String name) {
   public Crane {
      this.numberEggs = 10; // DOES NOT COMPILE
   }
}
```

#### Overloaded Constructors
In the record you can also create overloaded construcor
```java
public record Crane(int numberEggs, String name) {
   public Crane(String firstName, String lastName) {
      this(0, firstName + " " + lastName);
   }
}
```

## Declaring an Inner Class

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">An inner class, also called a member inner class, is a non-`static`</mark> type defined at the member level of a class (the same level as the methods, instance variables, and constructors). Because they are not top-level types, they can use any of the four access levels, not just `public` and package access.

Inner classes have the following properties:

![[Recording 20241031152703.webm]]

- Can be declared `public`, `protected`, package, or `private`
- Can extend a class and implement interfaces
- Can be marked `abstract` or `final`
- Can access members of the outer class, including `private` members

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">the inner class can access variables in the outer class without doing anything special.</mark>


![[Recording 20241031152620.webm]]

#### Referencing Members of an Inner Class

![[Recording 20241031154202.webm]]

 
```java 
public class A {
2:     private int x = 10;
3:     class B {
4:        private int x = 20;
5:        class C {
6:           private int x = 30;
7:           public void allTheX() {
8:              System.out.println(x);        // 30
9:              System.out.println(this.x);   //  30
10:             System.out.println(B.this.x); // 20
11:             System.out.println(A.this.x); // 10
12:    } } }
13:    public static void main(String[] args) {
14:       A a = new A();
15:       A.B b = a.new B();
16:       A.B.C c = b.new C();
17:       c.allTheX();
18: }}

```

Yes, this code makes us cringe too. It has two nested classes. Line 14 instantiates the outermost one. Line 15 uses the awkward syntax to instantiate a `B`. Notice that the type is `A.B`. We could have written `B` as the type because that is available at the member level of `A`. Java knows where to look for it. On line 16, we instantiate a `C`. This time, the `A.B.C` type is necessary to specify. `C` is too deep for Java to know where to look. Then line 17 calls a method on the instance variable `c`.

Lines 8 and 9 are the type of code that we are used to seeing. They refer to the instance variable on the current class—the one declared on line 6, to be precise. Line 10 uses `this` in a special way. We still want an instance variable. But this time, we want the one on the `B` class, which is the variable on line 4. Line 11 does the same thing for class `A`, getting the variable from line 2.

#### Inner class require an instance
```Java
        public class Fox {
           private class Den {}
           public void goHome() {
              new Den();
           }
           public static void visitFriend() {
              new Den(); // DOES NOT COMPILE
           }
        }
 
        public class Squirrel {
           public void visitFox() {
              new Den(); // DOES NOT COMPILE
           }
        }
```
The first constructor call compiles because `goHome()` is an instance method, and therefore the call is associated with the `this` instance. The second call does not compile because it is called inside a `static` method. You can still call the constructor, but you have to explicitly give it a reference to a `Fox` instance.

The last constructor call does not compile for two reasons. Even though it is an instance method, it is not an instance method inside the `Fox` class. Adding a `Fox` reference would not fix the problem entirely, though. `Den` is `private` and not accessible in the `Squirrel` class.


### Creating a _static_ Nested Class
A static nested class is a static member type within an outer class. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">It can be instantiated independently of the outer class instance</mark>, unlike an inner class, but it cannot access the outer class's instance members. It behaves similarly to a top-level class, with the following differences:

- It resides within the namespace of the enclosing class, which must be referenced to access it.
- It can be declared as private or protected.
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">The enclosing class can access the static nested class’s fields and methods.</mark>

```Java
1: public class Park {
2:    static class Ride {
3:       private int price = 6;
4:    }
5:    public static void main(String[] args) {
6:       var ride = new Ride();
7:       System.out.println(ride.price);
8: } }
```

### Writing a Local Class

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">A local class is a nested class defined within a method</mark>, existing only while the method is active and going out of scope once the method returns. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">It can only be instantiated within that method</mark>, but instances can still be returned from it. Local classes can also be declared in constructors and initializers.

Key properties of local classes:
- They lack an access modifier.
- They can be marked as final or abstract.
- They have access to the enclosing class's fields and methods (when in an instance method).
- They can access final or effectively final local variables.

example

```java
1:  public class PrintNumbers {
2:     private int length = 5;
3:     public void calculate() {
4:        final int width = 20;
5:        class Calculator {
6:           public void multiply() {
7:              System.out.print(length * width);
8:           }
9:        }
10:       var calculator = new Calculator();
11:       calculator.multiply();
12:    }
13:    public static void main(String[] args) {
14:       var printer = new PrintNumbers();
15:       printer.calculate();  // 100
16:    }
17:
```

Local variables can be referenced if they are final or effectively final. For example:

```Java
public void processData() {
   final int length = 5;
   int width = 10;
   int height = 2;
   class VolumeCalculator {
      public int multiply() {
         return length * width * height; // DOES NOT COMPILE
      }
   }
   width = 2;
}
```

<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Earlier, we mentioned that the compiler generates a separate `.class` file for each inner class. A separate class has no way to refer to a local variable. However, if the local variable is `final` or effectively final, Java can handle it by passing _a copy of the value or reference variable_ to the constructor of the local class. If it weren't `final` or effectively final, these tricks wouldn't work because the value could change after the copy was made.</mark>


### Defining an Anonymous Class

An anonymous class is a type of local class without a name, declared and instantiated in one line using `new`, a type name, and braces `{}`. It must extend a class or implement an interface, ideal for short, single-use implementations. For example:

```Java
1:  public class ZooGiftShop {
2:     abstract class SaleTodayOnly {
3:        abstract int dollarsOff();
4:     }
5:     public int admission(int basePrice) {
6:        SaleTodayOnly sale = new SaleTodayOnly() {
7:           int dollarsOff() { return 3; }
8:        }; // Don't forget the semicolon!
9:        return basePrice - sale.dollarsOff();
10: } }
```

### Anonymous Classes and Lambda Expressions

Before Java 8, <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">anonymous classes were commonly used for asynchronous tasks and event handlers</mark>. For example, here's an anonymous class used as an event handler in a JavaFX application:
```java
     var redButton = new Button();
        redButton.setOnAction(new EventHandler<ActionEvent>() {
           public void handle(ActionEvent e) {
              System.out.println("Red button pressed!");
           }
        });
```
Since the introduction of lambda expressions, anonymous classes are now often replaced with much shorter implementations:
```java
Button redButton = new Button();
        redButton.setOnAction(e -> System.out.println("Red button pressed!"));
```

|Permitted modifiers|Inner class|`static` nested class|Local class|Anonymous class|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Access modifiers|All|All|None|None|
|`abstract`|Yes|Yes|Yes|No|
|`final`|Yes|Yes|Yes|No|

| Inner class                                               | `static` nested class | Local class | Anonymous class                         |                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Can extend a class or implement any number of interfaces? | Yes                   | Yes         | Yes                                     | No—must have exactly one superclass or one interface |
| Can access instance members of enclosing class?           | Yes                   | No          | Yes (if declared in an instance method) | Yes (if declared in an instance method)              |
| Can access local variables of enclosing method?           | N/A                   | N/A         | Yes (if `final` or effectively final)   | Yes (if `final` or effectively final)                |
## Understanding polymorphism

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Polymorphism is an object-oriented programming concept that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass</mark>. It enables methods to perform different actions based on the object's actual class, even if they share the same method name.

For example, if `Animal` is a superclass with a method `speak()`, subclasses like `Dog` and `Cat` can each implement `speak()` differently. When calling `speak()` on an `Animal` object, polymorphism ensures the correct version is used based on whether the object is a `Dog`, `Cat`, etc. This promotes flexibility and simplifies code, as one interface can work with multiple data types.

### Object vs references

In Java, all objects are accessed by reference, meaning you don't access the object directly. Conceptually, the object exists in memory, allocated by the Java Runtime Environment, and remains unchanged regardless of the reference type. For example, since all objects inherit `java.lang.Object`, they can be reassigned to it.


```java
Lemur lemur = new Lemur();
Object lemurAsObject = lemur;
```


Though the `Lemur` object is assigned to a different reference type, it remains a `Lemur` in memory. However, using the `lemurAsObject` reference limits access to `Lemur` methods, requiring an explicit cast to regain access.

![[Pasted image 20241101000734.png]]

### Casting Objects

Changing the reference type caused us to lose access to specific members in the subclass. We can regain access by casting the object back to its original subclass.

```java
Lemur lemur = new Lemur();
 
Primate primate = lemur;       // Implicit Cast to supertype
 
Lemur lemur2 = (Lemur)primate; // Explicit Cast to subtype
 
Lemur lemur3 = primate;        // DOES NOT COMPILE (missing cast)
```

1. Casting a reference from a subtype to a supertype doesn't require an explicit cast.
2. Casting a reference from a supertype to a subtype requires an explicit cast.
3. At runtime, an invalid cast of a reference to an incompatible type results in a `ClassCastException` being thrown.
4. The compiler disallows casts to unrelated types.

#### Casting Interfaces

While the compiler enforces casting rules for unrelated classes, it has less certainty with interfaces due to multiple inheritance. A class may not implement an interface, but a subclass might. Thus, when holding a reference to a class, the compiler cannot determine its specific subtype.

Now, let’s consider an example: Does the following program compile?

```java
1: interface Canine {}
2: interface Dog {}
3: class Wolf implements Canine {}
4:
5: public class BadCasts {
6:    public static void main(String[] args) {
7:       Wolf wolfy = new Wolf();
8:       Dog badWolf = (Dog)wolfy;
9:    } }
```

In this program, a `Wolf` object is assigned to a `Wolf` reference on line 7. The compiler's ability to enforce rules with interfaces is limited because a reference type may not implement an interface, but a subclass could. This allows the invalid cast to the `Dog` reference type on line 8, despite `Dog` and `Wolf` being unrelated. Although the code compiles, it still throws a `ClassCastException` at runtime.

The compiler enforces one rule for interface casting: it disallows casting from an interface reference to an object reference if the object type cannot implement the interface, like a final class. For example, if the `Wolf` interface is final, the cast to `Dog` will not compile, as no subclasses of `Wolf` can implement it.

### The _instanceof_ Operator

The instanceof operator can be used to check whether an object belong to a particular class or interface  

### Polymorphism and Method Overriding

```java
class Penguin {
   public int getHeight() { return 3; }
   public void printInfo() {
      System.out.print(this.getHeight());
   }
}
 
public class EmperorPenguin extends Penguin {
   public int getHeight() { return 8; }
   public static void main(String []fish) {
      new EmperorPenguin().printInfo();
   }
}
// result is 8
```

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Polymorphism in Java allows methods to be overridden at runtime</mark>, enabling complex inheritance models where subclasses can implement custom methods. This means the parent class doesn't need updates to use overridden methods, which will be called whenever invoked. You can restrict polymorphism by marking methods as final, preventing them from being overridden.


## Summary of Advanced Object-Oriented Design

- **Interfaces:**
  - Support multiple inheritance.
  - Implicit modifiers added by the compiler.
  - Six types of interface members: abstract methods, static constants, default methods, static methods, private methods, private static methods.

- **Enums:**
  - Compile-time constant properties.
  - Simple enums consist of a list of values; complex enums can include constructors, methods, and fields.
  - Usable in switch statements; abstract methods in enums require implementations from each enum value.

- **Sealed Classes:**
  - Allow classes to function like enumerated types with limited subclasses.
  - Subclasses must be marked final, sealed, or non-sealed.
  - Permits clause may be omitted if subclasses are defined in the same file.

- **Records:**
  - Compact declaration of immutable and encapsulated POJOs.
  - Automatic creation of accessors, a long constructor, and implementations of `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()`.
  - Support for overloaded and compact constructors; no instance variables allowed.

- **Nested Types:**
  - Four types: inner classes (require outer class instance), static nested classes (do not require outer class instance), local classes (defined within a method), and anonymous classes (unnamed and extend a single class or implement one interface).
  - Inner, local, and anonymous classes can access private members of the enclosing class.

- **Polymorphism:**
  - Central to Java; objects can be accessed in various forms.
  - Understand the need for casts to access objects and differentiate between compile-time and runtime cast problems.

## Exam Essentials

- **Interface Creation:**
  - Create, extend, and implement interfaces; interfaces cannot extend classes.

- **Interface Method References:**
  - Non-static private, default, and abstract methods are instance-related; static methods reference only static members.

- **Enum Types:**
  - Define lists of values; use in switch statements; constructors are private.
