Here's a **Java OCP 17 Cheat Sheet** covering all the requested concepts. This guide will focus on **Enums**, **Records**, **Inner Classes**, **Polymorphism**, and other advanced object-oriented principles, along with some exam essentials.

### 1. Creating Enums

#### Basic Enum Declaration
- Enums are a special type of class that can hold a fixed set of constants.

```java
enum Day {
    MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY;
}
```

#### Enum Methods
- Enums are classes that can have fields, methods, and constructors.

```java
enum Day {
    MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY;

    public String getDayType() {
        return this == MONDAY ? "Weekday" : "Other Day";
    }
}
```

#### Using Enums in Switch Statement
- Enums can be used in `switch` statements.

```java
Day day = Day.MONDAY;
switch (day) {
    case MONDAY:
        System.out.println("Start of the week");
        break;
    case WEDNESDAY:
        System.out.println("Midweek");
        break;
    default:
        System.out.println("Other day");
}
```

#### Adding Constructors, Fields, and Methods
- Enums can have constructors, fields, and methods.

```java
enum Day {
    MONDAY("Start of the week"),
    FRIDAY("Weekend approaching"),
    SUNDAY("End of the week");

    private final String description;

    Day(String description) {
        this.description = description;
    }

    public String getDescription() {
        return description;
    }
}
```

#### Specifying the Subclass Modifier
- Enums can have different types of classes. You can specify subclass behavior.

```java
enum Status {
    SUCCESS, FAILURE;

    public static class SuccessStatus extends Status {}
}
```

#### Referencing Nested Subclasses
- Nested classes can be referenced and used inside enums.

```java
enum Vehicle {
    CAR(new Engine("V6")), TRUCK(new Engine("V8"));

    private final Engine engine;

    Vehicle(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }

    static class Engine {
        private final String type;
        Engine(String type) { this.type = type; }
    }
}
```

### 2. Encapsulating Data with Records

#### Applying Records
- Records are a special kind of class used for storing immutable data.

```java
public record Person(String name, int age) {}
```

#### Understanding Record Immutability
- Records are implicitly `final`, and their fields are implicitly `private` and `final`.

```java
Person person = new Person("John", 25);
System.out.println(person.name()); // Getter method for name
```

#### Declaringb Constructors
- Records can have custom constructors, and they automatically generate the constructor matching the fields.

```java
public record Person(String name, int age) {
    public Person {
        if (age < 0) throw new IllegalArgumentException("Age cannot be negative");
    }
}
```

#### The Long Constructor
- Records automatically generate a canonical constructor, but you can add validation or custom behavior.

```java
public record Employee(String name, double salary) {
    public Employee {
        if (salary < 0) throw new IllegalArgumentException("Salary can't be negative");
    }
}
```

#### Compact Constructors
- Records allow compact constructors where field validation is embedded.

```java
public record Product(String name, double price) {
    public Product { if (price <= 0) throw new IllegalArgumentException("Price must be positive"); }
}
```

#### Overloaded Constructors
- You can overload constructors within records.

```java
public record Address(String street, String city, String zip) {
    public Address(String street, String city) {
        this(street, city, "Unknown");
    }
}
```

### 3. Declaring Constructors and Inner Classes

#### Declaring an Inner Class
- Inner classes are classes defined within another class.

```java
class Outer {
    class Inner {
        void print() { System.out.println("Inner class method"); }
    }
}
```

#### Referencing Members of an Inner Class
- You can reference members of the outer class from the inner class.

```java
class Outer {
    private String message = "Outer class";

    class Inner {
        void print() { System.out.println(message); }
    }
}
```

#### Inner Class Requires an Instance
- Non-static inner classes require an instance of the outer class.

```java
Outer outer = new Outer();
Outer.Inner inner = outer.new Inner();
```

#### Creating a Static Nested Class
- Static nested classes donâ€™t require an instance of the outer class.

```java
class Outer {
    static class Nested {
        void print() { System.out.println("Static Nested Class"); }
    }
}
```

#### Writing a Local Class
- Local classes are defined within methods.

```java
void method() {
    class LocalClass {
        void display() { System.out.println("Local class method"); }
    }
}
```

#### Defining an Anonymous Class
- Anonymous classes are used to create class instances in place.

```java
Runnable r = new Runnable() {
    public void run() { System.out.println("Anonymous class"); }
};
```

#### Anonymous Classes and Lambda Expressions
- Anonymous classes are often replaced by lambdas.

```java
Runnable r = () -> System.out.println("Lambda expression");
```

### 4. Understanding Polymorphism

#### Object vs References
- A reference type determines what methods can be called, not the object type.

```java
Animal animal = new Dog();
animal.sound();  // Dog's implementation
```

#### Casting Objects
- Casting is required to access subclass-specific methods.

```java
Object obj = new Dog();
Dog dog = (Dog) obj;
```

#### Casting Interfaces
- Casting can be done between interface types, provided they are compatible.

```java
Runnable r = new Thread();
Thread t = (Thread) r;  // Downcasting
```

#### The `instanceof` Operator
- `instanceof` checks if an object is an instance of a class or implements an interface.

```java
if (animal instanceof Dog) {
    Dog dog = (Dog) animal;
}
```

#### Polymorphism and Method Overriding
- Polymorphism allows overridden methods in subclasses to be called via references of the superclass type.

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() { System.out.println("Generic Animal Sound"); }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() { System.out.println("Bark"); }
}

Animal animal = new Dog();
animal.sound();  // Outputs "Bark"
```

### 5. Summary of Advanced Object-Oriented Design

- **Inheritance** allows for method overriding and extends class functionality.
- **Interfaces** allow for defining method contracts, while classes provide method implementation.
- **Abstract Classes** cannot be instantiated, and often have partially implemented methods.
- **Polymorphism** enables method overriding and dynamic method dispatch.
- **Encapsulation** keeps data safe and hidden using access modifiers.

### 6. Exam Essentials for OCP 17

- **Inner Classes**: Recognize the different types of inner classes and their behaviors.
- **Polymorphism**: Be comfortable with method overriding, casting, and `instanceof`.
- **Lambda Expressions**: Practice using functional interfaces and stream operations.
