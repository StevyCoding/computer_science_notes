### Access Modifiers

An access modifier determines what classes a method can be accessed from. Think of it like a security guard. Some classes are good friends, some are distant relatives, and some are complete strangers. Access modifiers help to enforce when these components are allowed to talk to each other. Java offers four choices of access modifier:

- **private** The `private` modifier means the method can be called only from within the same class.
- **Package Access** With package access, the method can be called only from a class in the same package. This one is tricky because there is no keyword. You simply omit the access modifier. Package access is sometimes referred to as package-private or default access (even within this book!).
- **protected** The `protected` modifier means the method can be called only from a class in the same package or a subclass.
- **public** The `public` modifier means the method can be called from anywhere.



### Instance Variable Modifiers

Like methods, instance variables can use access modifiers, such as `private`, package, `protected`, and `public`. Remember, package access is indicated by the lack of any modifiers. We cover each of the different access modifiers shortly in this chapter. Instance variables can also use optional specifiers, described in [Table 5.3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ocp-oracle-certified/9781119864585/c05.xhtml#c05-tbl-0003).

[TABLE 5.3](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ocp-oracle-certified/9781119864585/c05.xhtml#R_c05-tbl-0003) Optional specifiers for instance variables

|Modifier|Description|Chapter Covered|
|---|---|---|
|`final`|Specifies that the instance variable must be initialized with each instance of the class exactly once|Chapter 5|
|`volatile`|Instructs the JVM that the value in this variable may be modified by other threads|[Chapter 13](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ocp-oracle-certified/9781119864585/c13.xhtml)|
|`transient`|Used to indicate that an instance variable should not be serialized with the class|[Chapter 14](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ocp-oracle-certified/9781119864585/c14.xhtml)|

Looks like we only need to discuss `final` in this chapter! If an instance variable is marked `final`, then it must be assigned a value when it is declared or when the object is instantiated. Like a local `final` variable, it cannot be assigned a value more than once, though. The following `PolarBear` class demonstrates these properties:

## Working with Varargs

Varargs (variable-length arguments) in Java allow you to pass a variable number of arguments to a method. This feature is especially useful when you don't know in advance how many arguments will be passed. It provides a clean and convenient way to handle multiple arguments without needing to overload methods for different numbers of parameters.

### Syntax

To define a method that takes varargs, you use an ellipsis (`...`) followed by the type of the arguments. The varargs parameter must be the last parameter in the method's parameter list.

### Example of Varargs

Here’s a simple example demonstrating how to use varargs:

```java
public class VarargsExample {

    // Method that takes a variable number of integers
    public static void printNumbers(int... numbers) {
        for (int number : numbers) {
            System.out.println(number);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        printNumbers(1, 2, 3);          // Passing three arguments
        printNumbers(4, 5, 6, 7, 8);    // Passing five arguments
        printNumbers();                  // No arguments passed
    }
}
```

### Output

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
```

### Key Points About Varargs

1. **Single Varargs Parameter**: A method can have only one varargs parameter. If you try to declare multiple varargs parameters, the compiler will throw an error.

   ```java
   // This will not compile
   public void exampleMethod(int... numbers, String... strings) {
       // Error: variable arguments can only be used once
   }
   ```

2. **Array Representation**: When you use varargs, Java treats the arguments as an array within the method. This means you can access the individual arguments using array indexing.

3. **Method Overloading**: You can overload methods with a varargs parameter. However, when you overload, be careful with the types of parameters you use to ensure there’s no ambiguity.

   ```java
   public void exampleMethod(int a) {
       System.out.println("Single int: " + a);
   }

   public void exampleMethod(int... numbers) {
       System.out.println("Varargs method: " + numbers.length + " arguments");
   }
   ```

4. **Performance**: Using varargs can have a slight performance overhead because it creates an array to hold the passed arguments. However, for most applications, this overhead is negligible.

5. **Compatibility with Other Parameters**: You can mix varargs with other parameters, but the varargs parameter must always come last.

   ```java
   public void exampleMethod(String message, int... numbers) {
       System.out.println(message);
       for (int number : numbers) {
           System.out.println(number);
       }
   }
   ```

### Using Varargs with Other Method Parameters

Finally! You get to do something other than identify whether method declarations are valid. Instead, you get to look at method calls. Can you figure out why each method call outputs what it does? For now, feel free to ignore the `static` modifier in the `walkDog()` method declaration; we cover that later in the chapter.

```
1:  public class DogWalker {
```

Line 6 passes `1` as `start` but nothing else. This means Java creates an array of length `0` for `steps`. Line 7 passes `1` as `start` and one more value. Java converts this one value to an array of length `1`. Line 8 passes `1` as `start` and two more values. Java converts these two values to an array of length `2`. Line 9 passes `1` as `start` and an array of length 2 directly as `steps`.

You've seen that Java will create an empty array if no parameters are passed for a vararg. However, it is still possible to pass `null` explicitly. The following snippet does compile:

```
walkDog(1, null); // Triggers NullPointerException in walkDog()
```

Since `null` isn't an `int`, Java treats it as an array reference that happens to be `null`. It just passes on the `null` array object to `walkDog()`. Then the `walkDog()` method throws an exception because it tries to determine the length of `null`.
### Summary

Varargs in Java provide a flexible way to handle methods that require a variable number of arguments. They simplify method calls, especially in cases where the number of parameters can vary widely. Just remember the rules regarding their placement and usage, and you can leverage this feature effectively in your Java applications.


In Java, when you pass data to a method, it can be passed in two ways depending on the type of the data: **pass by value** or **pass by reference**. However, Java only uses **pass by value**, though it behaves differently for primitive types and objects. Let's break down how data is passed in these cases:

### 1. **Passing Primitive Types (Pass by Value)**

For primitive types (e.g., `int`, `float`, `char`, etc.), Java passes a **copy of the value** to the method. The original value remains unchanged, no matter what happens inside the method.

#### Example:
```java
public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 10;
        modifyPrimitive(x);
        System.out.println(x); // Output: 10
    }

    static void modifyPrimitive(int a) {
        a = 20; // This only modifies the local copy
    }
}
```

- **Explanation**: The value of `x` is passed by value. Inside `modifyPrimitive`, a copy of `x` (which is 10) is made. When we change `a` to 20, it doesn’t affect the original `x` in the `main()` method. So the output is still `10`.

### 2. **Passing Object References (Pass by Value, but Reference Copy)**

For objects, Java also passes **by value**, but it passes the **value of the reference** to the object, not the object itself. This means that the method gets a copy of the reference to the object. If the object's fields are modified inside the method, the changes are reflected outside the method because both the original and the copied reference point to the same object in memory.

However, if you reassign the reference inside the method (i.e., point it to a new object), the change is not reflected outside the method.

#### Example 1: Modifying the object's fields
```java
class Person {
    String name;

    Person(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person person = new Person("Alice");
        modifyPerson(person);
        System.out.println(person.name); // Output: Bob
    }

    static void modifyPerson(Person p) {
        p.name = "Bob"; // Modifies the same object
    }
}
```

- **Explanation**: The `person` object is passed by value, but the value is a reference to the object. Inside the `modifyPerson` method, the reference `p` points to the same object as `person`, so changing `p.name` affects the original `person`.

#### Example 2: Reassigning the reference (no change to the original reference)
```java
class Person {
    String name;

    Person(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person person = new Person("Alice");
        reassignPerson(person);
        System.out.println(person.name); // Output: Alice
    }

    static void reassignPerson(Person p) {
        p = new Person("Bob"); // This only changes the local reference
    }
}
```

- **Explanation**: In this case, the method `reassignPerson` creates a new `Person` object and assigns it to the local reference `p`. However, this does not affect the original `person` in the `main()` method because Java passes the reference **by value**, meaning `p` is just a copy of the original reference. Once `p` is reassigned, it no longer points to the original object, and the change isn't reflected outside the method.

### Summary

- **Primitive Types**: Java passes a copy of the actual value (pass by value), and changes inside the method do not affect the original variable.
  
- **Object References**: Java passes a copy of the reference (pass by value), meaning the method can modify the object's state but cannot reassign the original reference to a new object.

This distinction is crucial when understanding how data is shared and modified across methods in Java.
