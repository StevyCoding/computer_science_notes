Hereâ€™s a structured **to-do list** to help you master the topics for your **Java SE 17 Developer (1Z0-829)** certification. This list follows the chapters from the study material you provided:

---

## **1. Foundations (Basic Java Skills)**
- **Building Blocks**
  - Understand the class structure and `main()` method.
  - Work with package declarations, imports, and data types.
  - Manage variable scope and object destruction.

- **Operators**
  - Practice unary, binary, and ternary operators.
  - Understand operator precedence.

- **Making Decisions**
  - Use `if-else`, `switch`, and loops (`while`, `for`, `do-while`).
  - Learn branching with `break`, `continue`, and labels.

---

## **2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Class Design**
  - Master inheritance, constructors, and abstract classes.
  - Create immutable objects and understand encapsulation.

- **Beyond Classes**
  - Implement interfaces and work with enums.
  - Use records and sealed classes.

---

## **3. Functional Programming & APIs**
- **Lambdas and Functional Interfaces**
  - Write lambdas and use method references.
  - Use built-in functional interfaces like `Predicate`, `Function`.

- **Core APIs**
  - Manipulate strings and use `StringBuilder`.
  - Work with arrays, math operations, and date-time APIs.

---

## **4. Collections, Streams, and Generics**
- **Collections and Generics**
  - Explore `List`, `Set`, `Map`, `Queue`, and `Deque`.
  - Work with comparators and learn generic types.

- **Streams**
  - Understand streams, Optional, and pipeline operations.
  - Work with primitive and advanced streams.

---

## **5. Error Handling & Modular Programming**
- **Exceptions and Localization**
  - Recognize checked vs. unchecked exceptions.
  - Handle exceptions with `try-catch-finally` and try-with-resources.
  - Learn about localization and resource bundles.

- **Modules**
  - Create modular programs and understand `module-info.java`.
  - Manage services, directives, and migration strategies.

---

## **6. Concurrency and I/O**
- **Concurrency**
  - Create threads using the concurrency API.
  - Understand thread-safe code and concurrent collections.
  - Use `ExecutorService` and parallel streams.

- **I/O**
  - Work with files, paths, and streams (NIO.2).
  - Serialize data and use advanced I/O APIs.

---

## **7. Database Interaction**
- **JDBC**
  - Connect to databases and use `PreparedStatement`.
  - Manage `ResultSet` and transactions.

---

## **Action Plan**
1. **Create a Study Schedule**: Allocate time to each topic based on difficulty and your familiarity.
2. **Practice Coding**: Build small programs for key concepts like collections, lambdas, and streams.
3. **Review Sample Questions**: Go through the review questions at the end of each chapter.
4. **Mock Exams**: Take practice tests regularly to monitor your progress.
5. **Revise Exam Essentials**: Focus on the summary points highlighted in each chapter.
6. **Hands-on Projects**: Work on modular programs, concurrency tasks, and JDBC connectivity to gain practical experience.

---

By following this plan systematically, youâ€™ll be well-prepared to pass the **Java SE 17 Developer (1Z0-829)** exam. Good luck! ðŸš€
