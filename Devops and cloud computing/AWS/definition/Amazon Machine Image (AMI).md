An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a pre-configured virtual machine image that contains the necessary information to launch an instance (a virtual server) in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). It serves as a template for creating instances with a specific configuration, including the operating system, application server, and applications.

Key points about AMIs:

1. **Base for Instances:** AMIs are the foundation for [[AWS services|EC2]] instances. When you launch an instance, you specify the AMI to use, and the instance is launched with the configuration defined in that AMI.
    
2. **Customization:** Users can create custom AMIs based on their specific requirements. This allows for the inclusion of custom software, configurations, and updates.
    
3. **Public and Private AMIs:** AWS provides a variety of public AMIs that users can use as-is or customize. Users can also create their own private AMIs for more specialized needs.
    
4. **Instance Store and Amazon EBS Backing:** AMIs can be backed by either Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes or instance store volumes. Instance store-backed AMIs use the local instance storage on the host computer, while EBS-backed AMIs use Amazon EBS volumes for storage.
    
5. **Lifecycle:** AMIs can be copied, shared, and versioned. This allows for collaboration and reuse of standardized configurations.
    
6. **Global and Regional Scope:** While AMIs are global resources, they are associated with a specific region. You can copy an AMI from one region to another.
    
7. **AMI IDs:** Each AMI is uniquely identified by an ID, and users can refer to AMIs by their IDs when launching instances.
    
8. **Community and Marketplace AMIs:** In addition to user-created and public AMIs, there are also community and marketplace AMIs. Community AMIs are created and shared by the AWS community, while marketplace AMIs are offered by third-party vendors.
    

Overall, AMIs simplify the process of launching instances, ensuring that the instances are provisioned with the desired software, configurations, and data.
