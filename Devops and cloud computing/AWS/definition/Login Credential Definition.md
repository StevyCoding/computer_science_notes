**Login credentials**, often referred to as **authentication credentials**, are a set of information used to verify and authenticate the identity of an individual or system seeking access to a secured environment, such as a computer system, network, application, or online service. These credentials are typically composed of one or more elements that uniquely identify the user or entity, along with a secret or private piece of information known only to the authorized user.

## Common Components of Login Credentials:

1. **Username or User ID:**
   - A unique identifier assigned to an individual or system to distinguish them from others.

2. **Password or Passphrase:**
   - A secret combination of characters chosen by the user.
