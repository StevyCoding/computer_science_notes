1. **Scalability:** Easily scale up or down by launching or terminating instances based on demand.
    
2. **Variety of Instances:** Offers a wide range of instance types optimized for different use cases, such as compute-optimized, memory-optimized, storage-optimized, etc.
    
3. **Customization:** Users can configure instances with their preferred operating systems, security settings, and application software.
    
4. **Pay-as-You-Go Pricing:** Users pay only for the compute capacity they consume, allowing for cost-effective solutions.
