# Summary 💡
A **Quota** in Kubernetes is used to control resource usage within a namespace, ensuring fair distribution of resources and maintaining cluster stability. It can limit CPU, memory, storage, and the number of objects. Quotas can be either hard (strict) or soft (flexible), and are applied through YAML or the Kubernetes API, assisting teams in managing resources efficiently.
