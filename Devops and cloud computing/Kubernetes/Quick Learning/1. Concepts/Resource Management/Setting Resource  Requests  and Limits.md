# Question / cue
- What a resource request ?
- where can they be configured ?
- is it important ?
# Key point :
- specify the min and max amount of cpu  & mem a container require to run
- Res req help to schedule containers on nodes with sufficient res
- limits enforce res quotas and prevent container from consuming too much
- those setting ccan be configured at the pod or container lvl using the res field in yml.
# Summary
Res req allow to specify the amoubnt of CPU & mem a container need to run, that pallow the container to run with enough res. In opposite, res limit enforce resource quotas and prevent container from consuming too much res. It's important to set res req & limit correctly to ensure optimal res usage in a k8s cluster.
