## Puppet Master

Puppet Master is the key mechanism which handles all the configuration related stuff. It applies the configuration to nodes using the Puppet agent.

## Puppet Agent

Puppet Agents are the actual working machines which are managed by the Puppet master. They have the Puppet agent daemon service running inside them.

## Config Repository

This is the repo where all nodes and server-related configurations are saved and pulled when required.

## Facts

**Facts**Â are the details related to the node or the master machine, which are basically used for analyzing the current status of any node. On the basis of facts, changes are done on any target machine. There are pre-defined and custom facts in Puppet.

## Catalog

All the manifest files or configuration which are written in Puppet are first converted to a compiled format called catalog and later those catalogs are applied on the target machine.
