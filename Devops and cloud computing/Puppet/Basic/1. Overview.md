Puppet, developed by Puppet Labs, is a robust configuration management tool that automates infrastructure management and configuration, embodying the concept of Infrastructure as Code. Written in Ruby DSL, Puppet converts infrastructure into manageable and configurable code. It operates on a client-server model, with a puppet master server and client nodes. Puppet can manage systems throughout their lifecycle, from initial setup to decommissioning.

## Feature of Puppet System

### Idempotency

Puppet supports idempotency, allowing the same configuration to be run multiple times on a machine without unintended changes. Puppet checks the machine's current status and makes updates only if there are specific changes. This feature aids in managing a machine's lifecycle, from creation to end-of-life, ensuring it remains updated over time without needing frequent rebuilds.


### Cross-platform

In Puppet, with the help of Resource Abstraction Layer (RAL) which uses Puppet resources, one can target the specified configuration of system without worrying about the implementation details and how the configuration command will work inside the system, which are defined in the underlying configuration file.

- In Puppet, the first thing what the Puppet master does is to collect the details of the target machine. Using the factor which is present on all Puppet nodes (similar to Ohai in Chef) it gets all the machine level configuration details. These details are collected and sent back to the Puppet master.
    
- Then the puppet master compares the retrieved configuration with defined configuration details, and with the defined configuration it creates a catalog and sends it to the targeted Puppet agents.
    
- The Puppet agent then applies those configurations to get the system into a desired state.
    
- Finally, once one has the target node in a desired state, it sends a report back to the Puppet master, which helps the Puppet master in understanding where the current state of the system is, as defined in the catalog.

## Puppet key component  

- **Puppet Resources**: Key components for modeling machines, each with its own implementation model to achieve the desired state.
- **Providers**: Fulfillers of resources, such as 'apt-get' and 'yum' for package management, with each platform having a default provider.
- **Manifest**: A collection of resources in functions or classes, written in Ruby, to configure target systems.
- **Modules**: Building blocks containing resources, files, templates, etc., that can be reused and distributed across different OS types.
- **Templates**: Ruby-based expressions for custom content, defined in manifests and copied to system locations.
- **Static Files**: General files required for tasks, located in the files directory of modules, and manipulated using the file resource in manifests.
