Ansibles automates the management of remote systems and controls their desired state.

As shown in the preceding figure, most Ansible environments have three main components:

**Control node**

A system on which Ansible is installed. You run Ansible commands such as `ansible` or `ansible-inventory` on a control node.

**Inventory**

A list of managed nodes that are logically organized. You create an inventory on the control node to describe host deployments to Ansible.

**Managed node**

A remote system, or host, that Ansible controls.
