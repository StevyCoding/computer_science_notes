Ansible provides open-source automation that reduces **complexity and runs everywhere**. Using Ansible lets you **automate virtually any task**. Here are some common use cases for Ansible:

- Eliminate repetition and simplify workflows
    
- Manage and maintain system configuration
    
- Continuously deploy complex software
    
- Perform **zero-downtime rolling updates**
    

Ansible uses simple, **human-readable scripts called playbooks to automate your tasks**. You declare the desired state of a local or remote system in your playbook. Ansible ensures that the system remains in that state.

As automation technology, Ansible is designed around the following principles:

<u>Agent-less architecture</u>

Low maintenance overhead by avoiding the installation of additional software across IT infrastructure.

<u>Simplicity</u>

Automation playbooks use straightforward YAML syntax for code that reads like documentation. Ansible is also decentralized, using SSH with existing OS credentials to access to remote machines.

<u>Scalability and flexibility</u>

Easily and quickly scale the systems you automate through a modular design that supports a large range of operating systems, cloud platforms, and network devices.

<u>Idempotence and predictability</u>

When the system is in the state your playbook describes Ansible does not change anything, even if the playbook runs multiple times.
